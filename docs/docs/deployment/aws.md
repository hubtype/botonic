**ðŸš§ ðŸš§ We're currently working to make self-hosted botonic projects to AWS available, if you're interested in beta testing this, please get in touch on our Slack channel ðŸš§ ðŸš§**

This is the best option if you:

- Want to use your own infra on AWS
- Need to integrate deeply with other AWS services

DON'T choose this option if you:

- Need **Whatsapp** integration
- Need to use **bot/human handoff**

  See [Deploy to Hubtype](/docs/deployment/hubtype) for these use cases.

## Deploy to AWS step by step
