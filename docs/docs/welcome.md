Botonic is a React-based framework that allows you to build conversational apps. Itâ€™s open source and it works on all messaging apps (including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or Telegram), and can be embedded it in your website or mobile app too.

**Botonic** helps you to create **Conversational Applications** to deliver a good user experience by using all the typical chatbot features like Guided flows, NLU, Multi-language, Media support (images, video, location...), Webviews, Human handoff or Webchat. Your Conversation app will learn fast, understand your needs, know you and help you for your transactions.
