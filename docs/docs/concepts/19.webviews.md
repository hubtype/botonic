Webviews are an essential part of Botonic and chatbots. They allow you to open standard webpages during a chat conversation, offering a rich experience and a set of features that are difficult to create with simple component messages.

For example, you can create a webview for choosing different products, selecting a range of dates from a datepicker, or making a purchase.

With Botonic, it's easier to create a webview than developing your own a webpage and integrating it with the Facebook app, inserting the Facebook SDK, keeping the bot conversation flow, etc.

## Structure of the webviews Directory

All the code related to webviews resides in its respective `src/webviews` directory. These are the essential elements it has to contain:

- **index.js**: where we define all the React Components inside the class WebviewApp. Additionally, it includes its constructor method, a way of defining the locales object from the bot.
- **component.js**: simple React Components you develop.

**Note:** With this structure, you don't have to worry about the communication between the bot and the webviews. You can just focus on adding new components to `index.js` and developing new ones. If you change the structure, do it at your own risk!

Now, let's integrate the bot with the webviews.

## Invoking the Webview

You can only open a webview with a `button`. Create an action to invoke the webviews, as shown in the example. In this case, we named a route which will be resolved by `src/webviews/index.js`.

We can pass parameters into the new component as shown below.

**src/actions/invoking_webviews.js**

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import {
  Text,
  Carousel,
  Element,
  Pic,
  Title,
  Subtitle,
  Button,
} from '@botonic/react'

import Example from '../webviews/example'

export default class extends React.Component {
  render() {
    //Here we render a Facebook Carousel with its proper assets and url routes for the webview
    return (
      <>
        <Text>
          Here I will give you some options of how helpful the use of Facebook
          webviews could be.
        </Text>
        <Carousel>
          <Element>
            <Pic src='https://botonic.io/images/botonic_react_logo-p-500.png' />
            <Title>Interacting with the bot</Title>
            <Subtitle>See how the communication bot-webview is done</Subtitle>
            <Button webview={Example} params={{ hola: 1 }}>
              Go
            </Button>
          </Element>
        </Carousel>
      </>
    )
  }
}
```

**Note:** You can also set the **[dimensions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webview/#height)** of the webview (available on Messenger phone version).

## Creating a Webview Component

First of all, we create a new component inside `src/webviews`.

**src/webviews/Example.js**

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { RequestContext } from '@botonic/react'

export default class Example extends React.Component {
  //for further information, see: https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
  static contextType = RequestContext

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Webview: Example</h1>
        <p>Params: {JSON.stringify(this.context.params)}</p>
        <button
          onClick={() =>
            this.context.closeWebview({
              path: 'hi',
              params: { date: new Date() },
            })
          }
        >
          Select today
        </button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

**Note:** The closeWebview function allows you to send data back to the bot in order to continue with the conversation flow.
In this example, you can see that we have a button, and when it's triggered we send the `path` to the bot with a params object which contains a new Date.

## Adding Components Into Routes

After having our component created, move to `src/webviews/index.js` and simply add the new component that was just created.

```javascript
import Example from './example'

export const webviews = [Example]
```

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>
