A dynamic carousel is an object that has multiple images or videos where you can showcase your products or information.
In the example below, taken from one of Botonic examples, a simple bot will display five men's or women's shirts and their price. We are getting the information for the clothes on the `Shopstyle API`.

First of all, we ask what are the user's interests. When we get it, we generate the carousel of the products.

Also, at the `botonicInit` necessary calls are made to grasp the values of api, which must be stored and returned so that they can be passed as parameters.

To make the call, we need `import fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch'` which needs to pass the URL, the method that in this case is a `GET method` and the parameters if needed. This call returns all the information on the `api`.
When we have all the product information, we can display the carousel.
The carousel can have at most ten elements, where each element will represent one product and will have its `name`, the `price`, an `image` and a `link` to the product page.

To access these values, we do a loop with all the products where we extract the values like `e.name`, `e.priceLabel`, etc.

**Note:** In order to import the `fetch` function from `isomorphic-fetch`, you need to install it into your bot. Please do: `npm install isomorphic-fetch`

**src/actions/carousel.js**

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Carousel, Element, Pic, Title, Subtitle, Button } from '@botonic/React'
import fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static async botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath }) {
    const api_key = 'uid8900-40385330-57'
    const url =
      'http://api.shopstyle.com/api/v2/products?pid=' +
      api_key +
      '&fts=mens-shirts&offset=0&limit=5'
    const res = await fetch(url, {
      url: url,
      method: 'GET',
      params: {},
    })

    let resp = await res.json()
    return { resp }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Carousel>
        {this.props.resp.products.map((e, i) => (
          <Element key={e.name}>
            <Pic src={e.image.sizes.Best.url} />
            <Title>{e.name}</Title>
            <Subtitle>{e.priceLabel}</Subtitle>
            <Button url={e.clickUrl}>Open Product</Button>
          </Element>
        ))}
      </Carousel>
    )
  }
}
```

**src/routes.js**
