Actions consist of simple units of logic that your bot can perform and the response that your bot generates.

## Simple Actions

Botonic allows creating simple actions without any logic inside. The simplest response form of an action is a plain text.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Text>Hello World</Text>
  }
}
```

With only a few modifications, we can also pass variables or external responses to the render method.

The `botonicInit` function is always called before the `render()` and it's asynchronous, which means that you can do all type of external API calls and use the responses in the `render()` method as an example.

In the example below, we are storing as a session variable the name that a user would have typed. Also we are declaring the variable `reminder` which we want to use inside the `render()` method.  
The session variables can be accessed within `render()` with `this.context.session`, and the ones declared inside `botonicInit()` scope with `this.props.{variableName}`.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text, RequestContext } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static contextType = RequestContext

  static async botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath }) {
    session.name = input.data
    let reminder = 'Mathematics'
    return { reminder }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <Text>Hi {this.context.session.name}, I really like your history!</Text>
        <Text>
          By the way, do you remember that today you have a {' '}
          {this.props.reminder} lesson?
        </Text>
      </>
    )
  }
}
```

## Data Persistence

We can access different types of information within the `botonicInit` function.

- **input:** the type of data and the user input.  
  `{'type': 'text', 'data': 'Hello, it's my first interaction'}`
- **session**: the session is a group of variables that is always available for any bot action. It is recalculated every time there is a user input. So if a variable is updated in any state of the bot, this variable is going to be available and updated in all the others actions.
- **params**: when a button redirects you to an action, you can pass attributes (parameters) to that action. The params store this information.
- **lastRoutePath**: the last path that the user has gone through.

The `render()` method defines what is returned as an output of the bot using components.

## Complex Actions

Sometimes it is helpful to pull information from an external site. You can do this within the `botonicInit()` method.

**./actions/example.js**

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch'
import { Text, RequestContext } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static contextType = RequestContext

  static async botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath }) {
    const api_key = 'uid8900-40385330-57'
    const url =
      'http://api.shopstyle.com/api/v2/products?pid=' +
      api_key +
      '&fts=' +
      input.data +
      '&offset=0&limit=5'
    const res = await fetch(url, {
      url: url,
      method: 'GET',
      params: {},
    })

    session.resp = await res.json()
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <>
        {this.context.session.resp.products.map((e, i) => (
          <Text key={i}>
            Product: {e.name}, Price: {e.priceLabel}
          </Text>
        ))}
      </>
    )
  }
}
```

**Note:** To import the `fetch` function, run `npm install isomorphic-fetch`.
