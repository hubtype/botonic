- Tutorial: Template with comments to learn by reading the source files.
- **[Childs](childs)**: Simple example on how childRoutes work.
- Intent: Bot that uses external AI like DialogFlow.
- **[Custom Webchat](template-custom-webchat)**: Customizable webchat that can be embedded in your website.
- **[Dynamic Carousel](template-dynamic-carousel)**: Bot that gets data from an external API and renders a Carousel. Carousels are horizontal scrollable elements with image, title and buttons for users to trigger an action.
- **[Human handoff](template-human-handoff)**: Simple bot that transfers the conversation to Hubtype Desk.
- **[NLU](template-nlu)**: Starter template for your project with NLU capabilities.
