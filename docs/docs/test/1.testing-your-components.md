As your Botonic project gets bigger, you must test every component of your bot to:

- Avoid introducing breaking changes.
- Decide whether the quality of the code is sufficient or not.
- Find as many bugs as possible.

Botonic provides a way of testing your bot, based on **[JEST](https://jestjs.io/)**.
You can execute your tests by running `botonic test` or `npm run test`.
We suggest that you use `npm run test` for a better visualization.

Let's see how you can define your tests by looking at the `childs` example:

**src/routes.js**

```javascript
import Hi from './actions/hi'
import Pizza from './actions/pizza'
import Sausage from './actions/sausage'
import Bacon from './actions/bacon'
import Pasta from './actions/pasta'
import Cheese from './actions/cheese'
import Tomato from './actions/tomato'

export const routes = [
  {
    path: 'hi',
    text: /^hi$/i,
    action: Hi,
    childRoutes: [
      {
        path: 'pizza',
        payload: /^pizza$/i,
        action: Pizza,
        childRoutes: [
          { path: 'sausage', payload: /^sausage$/i, action: Sausage },
          { path: 'bacon', payload: /^bacon$/i, action: Bacon },
        ],
      },
      {
        path: 'pasta',
        payload: /^pasta$/i,
        action: Pasta,
        childRoutes: [
          { path: 'cheese', payload: /^cheese$/i, action: Cheese },
          { path: 'tomato', payload: /^tomato$/i, action: Tomato },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
]
```

More concretely, let's focus on testing whether when we pass a payload with the value "pizza",
the Pizza action is rendered.

```javascript
{
  path: "hi", text: /^hi$/i, action: Hi,
  childRoutes: [
    {
      path: "pizza", payload: /^pizza$/i, action: Pizza, // <-- input to test
      childRoutes: [
        { path: "sausage", payload: /^sausage$/i, action: Sausage },
        { path: "bacon", payload: /^bacon$/i, action: Bacon },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

You can see the Pizza action will only be rendered after receiving a payload matching
the regular expression `/^pizza$/i`, with an empty session `{}` and coming from the `hi` path. This can be defined as follows:

```javascript
import { BotonicInputTester } from '@botonic/react'
let i = new BotonicInputTester(App)
i.payload('pizza', {}, 'hi')
```

In this way, the purpose of representing an input can be achieved.
Let's have a look now at how to represent an output action to be rendered.

**src/actions/pizza.js**

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text, Reply } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Text>
        You chose Pizza! Choose one ingredient:
        <Reply payload='sausage'>Sausage</Reply>
        <Reply payload='bacon'>Bacon</Reply>
      </Text>
    )
  }
}
```

Then, this component can be defined in the following way:

```javascript
import { BotonicOutputTester } from '@botonic/react'
let o = new BotonicOutputTester(App)
o.text(
  'You chose Pizza! Choose one ingredient:',
  o.replies(
    { text: 'Sausage', payload: 'sausage' },
    { text: 'Bacon', payload: 'bacon' }
  )
)
```

It's that simple! Now, alongside the methods [expect](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#expectvalue) and [toBe](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#tobevalue) of JEST, you can define the entire test like this:

**tests/app.test.js**

```javascript
import { BotonicInputTester, BotonicOutputTester } from '@botonic/react'

import App from '../src/app'

let i = new BotonicInputTester(App)
let o = new BotonicOutputTester(App)

// Put a name to your test
test('TEST: pizza.js', async () => {
  await expect(i.payload('pizza', {}, 'hi')) // Expected input
    .resolves.toBe(
      // Expected output
      o.text(
        'You chose Pizza! Choose one ingredient:',
        o.replies(
          { text: 'Sausage', payload: 'sausage' },
          { text: 'Bacon', payload: 'bacon' }
        )
      )
    )
})
```
