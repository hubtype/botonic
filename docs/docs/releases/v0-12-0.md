### Changed

- [Project](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic)

  - Most eslint rules config have been moved to root `.eslintrc.js`.

* [@botonic/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botonic/react)

  - `webchatReducer` moved to its own file.
  - `webchatReducer` split to reduce complexity.
  - Calls to `renderBrowser`/`renderNode` unified.

### Fixed

- [Project](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic)

  - pre-commit was not aborting when lint failed.
  - Fixed several eslint warnings.

* [@botonic/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botonic/cli)
  - Preserved `src/nlu` directories for all templates (added `.gitkeep` file). Remove these files before running botonic train.
  - Added missing calls with `await`.
  - Used `rimraf` in favor of `fs.rmdirSync`.
  - Templates: Call `CleanWebpackPlugin` with  
    `{ cleanOnceBeforeBuildPatterns: ['dist'] }` to prevent occasional builds from crashing. We strongly suggest to add this line in your bot's `webpack.config.js` if updating from previous versions.

- [@botonic/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botonic/react)

  - Fixed sending wrong payloads when a handover was ended in `botonic serve` mode.
  - `postMessage` promises are now forwarded.
  - Better scrollbar handling when Webchat is hovered.
  - Limit attachment sizes to 10MB.
  - Fixed attachments crashing in production build for Webchat (media messages will be no longer stored as binary data in local storage, so the content will only be available temporarily in `botonic serve` mode).
  - Webchat's theme properties such `message.bot.image`, `header.image`, `intro.image` and `triggerButton.image` are now accepting URLs.
  - Fixed issue causing Botonic Logo to be visible during few milliseconds in production.
  - Handled parent page scrolling issues in Webchat for iOS.

* [@botonic/plugin-contentful](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botonic/plugin-contentful)
  - `BotonicMsgConverter` is now using `replaceEmptyStringsWith` option with value.
  - New operations are available to clone Contents performing composable transformations.
  - New operations are available to traverse the chain of followUp fields of MessageContent.
  - When calculating the match substring and score between an utterance and a keyword, tokens are preferred to stems when comparing to keywords.
