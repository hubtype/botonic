# Added

- [Project](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic)

  - Scripts to upgrade dependencies, prepare botonic packages and update packages version.

* [@botonic/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botonic/react)

  - New webchat features:

    - Added support for custom Cover Component which will be shown when the chat is initiated. You can use it in order to collect information from enduser just before to start the conversation.
    - Now webchat will be displayed depending on the settings present in Hubtype Desk (set `visibility: 'dynamic'` in **webchat/index.js** to enable them, or as a parameter in `Botonic.render({appId:'YOUR_APP_ID', visibility: 'dynamic'})`. You can also pass a custom value or a custom function returning a boolean to handle webchat visbility (also through `visibility` option).
    - Added `Botonic.getVisibility()` function which returns a promise resolving to true or false depending on Hubtype Desk webchat visibility settings.
    - Added new `WebchatSettings` component to allow changing webchat features and styles dynamically.
