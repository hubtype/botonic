# **Introduction**

Botonic is a React-based framework that allows you to build amazing conversational experiences, also known as chatbots.
The term "chatbot" was coined a long time ago and refers to an intelligent artificial agent you can talk to as if it were a human. According to this definition, a “chatbot” must have a way to understand human natural language, have a human-level context of the world, be able to reason, and articulate responses in natural language. It's obvious that the technology to achieve all this does not exist yet, however, we can still solve practical problems and automate processes through modern text-based interfaces (like messaging apps) that include features like:

* Guided flows
* NLU
* Multi-language
* Keeping context
* Dealing with media (images, video, location...)
* Webviews
* Human handoff

That's why we like to talk about *conversational experiences* rather than *chatbots*, as the latter implies an AI-centric, text-only interaction with your bot. If you want your bot to deliver a good user experience, you'll need to take into account all of these elements. Botonic allows you to orchestrate all these pieces in a simple and elegant way.

Moreover, as a tool that aims to make developers' lives easier, Botonic will put a lot of effort in:

* CLI tools
* Integrable in a typical development workflow (git, CI, CD, etc)
* Testable
* Open-source
* Amazing Documentation, including examples, tutorials, and screencasts
* Create a welcoming and helpful community

Botonic is a project created by the [Hubtype](https://hubtype.com) team. Hubtype is a platform that allows companies to attend their customers on messaging apps by combining bots and humans.
The easiest way to put your botonic bot in production is to deploy it to Hubtype, as it offers:

* Easy deployments
* Automatic scaling
* Debug tools
* NLU retraining assistance
* 1-click integrations:
  * Messaging / Voice channels
  * Analytics
  * Helpdesks
  * NLU as a service
