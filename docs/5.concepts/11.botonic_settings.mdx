# Botonic Settings

## NLU Integrations
Integrate your bots with your preferred NLU services. For further information see the [NLU section](/concepts/nlu).

## Typing Options

`index.js` is the main file where all the stuff is exported for Botonic in order to get it working. 
Additionally, you can specify inside a `config` object a global value which will be applied to all the messages processed by the bot.

** src/index.js **
```javascript
export { routes } from './routes'
export { locales } from './locales'
export { plugins } from './plugins'
export { webchat } from './webchat'
export { webviews } from './webviews'
export const config = { defaultDelay: 1, defaultTyping: 1 }
```

* **defaultTyping**: Specifies how much seconds the typing component has to be displayed.
- **defaultDelay**: Specifies the seconds that pass before sending the order to process the user input.

Both options are set to 0 by default. Feel free to tune these parameters to obtain the expected behaviour of your bot.

You can also define these settings inside your messages. In this case, the values defined inside a message will have preference over the global settings.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
        <>
            <Text delay='2'>
                Hi!
            </Text>
            <Text typing='1'>
                How are you?
            </Text>
            <Text delay='1' typing='1'>
                I am very glad to see you again.
            </Text>
        </>
    )
  }
}
```
