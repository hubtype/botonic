# NLU

NLUs can be used by your app, product, or service to transform natural user requests into actionable data. This transformation occurs when a user input matches one of the intents in your bot.
**Botonic NLU** allows us to create different `intents` and assign keywords or phrases. These will match with the `intent` and direct to the corresponding route.

To use Botonic NLU, you can create a bot using the NLU template by running:

```bash
botonic new {BOT_NAME} nlu
```

Alternatively, if you already have a project, you can follow the steps below to setup Botonic NLU:

## Setup

### **1. Installing the Botonic NLU Plugin**

From within your project, enter the following command: 

```bash
npm install @botonic/plugin-nlu 
```

This command will install everything necessary to start working with your intents and entities.
> Note: Windows users should first use the command:
> `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools --vs2015`
>
>Followed by: `npm install @botonic/plugin-nlu`

Under the src files of your project, create a folder named `nlu`.  

### **2. Adding a Configuration File**
Under `nlu`, create a new file called `nlu.config.json`. This file defines which languages you want enabled and
 configures the training phase parameters. You must have at least this much in your file:

** src/nlu/nlu.config.json **

```javascript
{
  "langs": ["en"],
  "params": {
    "default": { }
  }
}
```

See the last section of this documentation for further details about the configuration.

### **3. Requiring the Plugin**

After setting all your necessary parameters, require the plugin in `src/plugins.js`. You must set its `id` to **nlu** for the plugin to function.

**src/plugins.js**
```javascript
import nluConfig from './nlu/nlu.config.json'
export const plugins = [
  {
    id: 'nlu',
    resolve: require('@botonic/plugin-nlu'),
    options: nluConfig
  }
]
```
### **4. Defining your Intents and Entities**  
### **Intents**  

Under the `nlu` folder, create a folder called `utterances`, which will contain your multilingual intents. For every language you want to support, 
create a folder under `src/nlu/utterances` with its language code (it must be [ISO 639-1](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data)), such as `en` for English.

Then add a text file for each intent you want to create, naming them `{YOUR_INTENT}.txt`, and fill them with possible ways to express each 
intent. **Every sentence must be on a different line of the file.**

For example, you could have the following files under **src/nlu/utterances/en**:
* BookRestaurant.txt
* GetDirections.txt
* Greetings.txt  

This could be a list of examples of greetings defined in `Greetings.txt` file:  

**src/nlu/utterances/en/Greetings.txt**
```txt
Hey!
Hi!
Good morning!
Morning!
What's up bot?
hi
Good afternoon!
How are you?
morning
hello
```

### **Entities**
Botonic NLU also has `entities` which are used for extracting parameter values from natural language inputs. You can define your entities within an utterance like this: `[ENTITY_NAME](type)`.  

**src/nlu/utterances/en/BookRestaurant.txt**
```txt
Find me a table for four for dinner tonight
Book a table for today's lunch at [Eggy's](Restaurant) for 3 people
Book a table at a restaurant near [Times Square](Place) for 2 people tomorrow night
Book a table for friday 8pm for 2 people at [Delicatessen](Restaurant)
```

With this notation we are telling Botonic NLU that `Times Square` is the value for an entity of type `Place`.
`Place` is a named entity type as well as `Person`, `Organization` or `Date` and can be accessed with the following methods:
* `Place`: `input.entities.places`
* `Person`: `input.entities.people`
* `Organization`: `input.entities.organizations`
* `Date`: `input.entities.dates`

The entity recognition system is based on [spencermountain/compromise](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise), so this is the [full list](https://observablehq.com/@spencermountain/compromise-tags) of 
entity tags which are supported by default.  

## Training Phase
Now it's time to order Botonic NLU to deal with all the examples we have added so far. To do this, you have to type the following command:
```bash
botonic train
```
After this, the bot will be able to run predictions on new inputs.  
> Every time you make changes in your utterances, you will need to run again the command above so that the changes take effect.

## Usage

### **Defining Routes with Intents**
Once you've defined your intents, you can use them in the routes in the same way you use `text`, `payloads`, and the like. 
Below, we see how we might use them:

**routes.js**

```javascript
import Start from './actions/start'
import ShowRestaurants from './actions/show-restaurants'
import NotFound from './actions/not-found'
import ShowDirections from './actions/show-directions'

export const routes = [
      { input: i => i.confidence < 0.7, action: NotFound },
      { intent: 'Greetings', action: Start },
	  { intent: 'BookRestaurant', action: ShowRestaurants },
]
```

### **Using Entities within Actions**

Sometimes, you will need to capture custom entities, like `Restaurant`.
You can access your custom entitites with the method `input.entities.tags`. This list will contain all the custom tagged entity types with its values.

In the example below, we show how entities might be used within an action:  

**src/actions/show-restaurants**

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { RequestContext, Text } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static contextType = RequestContext
  static async botonicInit({ input, session, lastRoutePath }) {
    const getNotUndefinedCustomEntities = (entities, tag) =>
      entities.tags.length
        ? entities.tags.filter(e => e.tags.includes(tag)).map(res => res.value)
        : undefined

    let namedEntitiesPlace = input.entities.places.length
      ? input.entities.places
      : undefined

    let customEntitiesRestaurants = getNotUndefinedCustomEntities(
      input.entities,
      'Restaurant'
    )
    return { namedEntitiesPlace, customEntitiesRestaurants }
  }

  render() {
    if (
      this.props.customEntitiesRestaurants &&
      this.props.customEntitiesRestaurants.length
    ) {
      return (
          <Text>
            For sure! I will make a reservation at{' '}
            {this.props.customEntitiesRestaurants}
          </Text>
      )
    } else if (
      this.props.namedEntitiesPlace &&
      this.props.namedEntitiesPlace.length
    ) {
      return (
          <Text>
            Okay! Let's make a reservation close to{' '}
            {this.props.namedEntitiesPlace[0]}
          </Text>
      )
    } else {
      return (<Text>Where would you like to book a table?</Text>)
    }
  }
}
```
## Going Live

You can now run `botonic serve` to see how the bot runs in the development environment. You can also open the `Botonic Dev Console` by clicking the tab you see in the top-left corner for further details of the variables stored during the execution.

Finally, deploy your bot with `botonic deploy` and you will have a bot with a customized intent and entity recognition system!

## Hyperparameters Tuning and Multilingual Support

You can add more languages by specifying their language codes in the `langs` array after creating a new directory under `src/nlu/utterances/{newLanguageCode}` for the corresponding language. 
Additionally, if you wish to change your training parameters from the default, you can adjust them here. 
In the example below, we change the default values in the `default` section. We can also change the parameters for 
individual languages.

** src/nlu/nlu.config.json **

```javascript
{
  "langs": ["en", "es"],
  "params": {
    "default": {
      "EPOCHS": 4,
      "MAX_SEQ_LENGTH": null,
      "LEARNING_RATE": 0.01
    },
    "en": {
      "EPOCHS": 22
    },
    "es" :{
       "LEARNING_RATE": 0.02
    }
  }

}
```
The list of training parameters are listed below:
- **EMBEDDING**: Name of the type of embeddings we are using. Set to `'10k-fasttext'` by default.
- **EMBEDDING_DIM**: The dimensions of the embeddings we are using. Set to `300` by default.
- **TRAINABLE_EMBEDDINGS**: Whether to let the algorithm train with the pre-trained embeddings weights or not. If you have less utterances, then it's better
to set this options to `true`, otherwise, set it to `false` to take advantage of what the embedding already knows. Set to `true`by default.
- **LEARNING_RATE**: Specifies how much the weights are updated during training. Common values for this parameter are `0.01`, `0.03`, `0.1`. Set to `0.03` by default.
- **EPOCHS**: Defines the number of times that the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset. Set to `10` by default.
- **UNITS**: Defines how many intermediate neurons the algorithm has. Set to `21` by default.
- **MAX_SEQ_LENGTH**: Defines which is the maximum length of words the phrases will be truncated. Although it is not recommended you can also set this parameter to `null` to automatically determine the maximum length. Set to `50` by default.
- **VALIDATION_SPLIT**: Defines the percentage of utterances from your examples used to obtain the metrics of the algorithm. Set to `0.2` by default.
- **DROPOUT_REG**: It's used for reducing overfitting and improving the generalization of neural network. Set to `0.2` by default.

If the plugin is not able to correctly identify the language of a new input, it will use the first language in the file.  

### Multilingual Support

> Currently the following pre-trained word embeddings are supported, so you can only train your bot in these languages. 
> We expect to support more in the near future. For more information, feel free to contact us at [Slack](http://botonic.slack.com).
>
> * You can also generate your own word embeddings following these [instructions](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic/tree/master/scripts).
