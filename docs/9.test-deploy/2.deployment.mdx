# Deployment

Testing your bot in the terminal with `botonic serve` is fast, easy and convenient when your bot is in development, but eventually you're going to have to test on a messaging platform. Not only is it the only way to accurately test how your bot will behave and perform, but many special features, like requesting location and sending files, will only work when they are run on the actual messaging platforms. Likewise, many features may look and work differently on different platforms.

*If you are running windows use `npm run start` instead of `botonic serve`*

## Deploy to Hubtype

From your command line terminal run:

```bash
botonic deploy
```

If it's the first time you deploy a bot, Botonic will ask you to enter your credentials. You can login with your email/password if you already signed up at [hubtype.com](https://hubtype.com/), otherwise you can create a new account right now, from the terminal. You'll also have to enter a name for your bot.

Botonic will then build your project and upload it to the Hubtype. That's it. You don't have to worry about servers, scaling or any other infrastructure. **Your bot will just work at any scale**.

Botonic will store your credentials in the `~/.botonic/credentials.json` file so you don't have to enter your email/password every time. If you want to deploy with another account you can run `botonic logout` or delete the `~/.botonic/` folder. The next time you deploy, you'll be prompted for new credentials.

Botonic will also store metadata about your bot in the file `.botonic.json` at the root of your project, so it remembers which bot in the cloud corresponds with your local bot.

There's one last step before our users can talk to our bot, which is connecting it to a messaging channel.
