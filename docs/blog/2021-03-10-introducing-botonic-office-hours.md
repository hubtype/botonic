Talking to our community has always been a priority for us. Not only it's an opportunity for us to help fellow developers getting started with the framework, but also a way for developers to help us shape future releases and the direction of the project.

That's why, inspired by [Simon Willson's Datasette Office Hours post](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/19/office-hours/), we decided to open office hours at Botonic too. We offer 30min slots all day (9am - 7pm CET) each Friday. We think this model will allow us to create personal connections with our community and have deeper conversations about topics such as:

- General doubts about the framework and feedback
- Detailed technical discussions: integrations, customisations, etc.
- Help with your project: configuration, bugs, etc.
- Getting involved in the open-source project
- Business opportunities: partnerships, sponsored features, etc.

### Schedule a <ins>free 30min online session</ins> with a Botonic expert now:

export const Calendly = () => {
const { InlineWidget } = require('react-calendly')
return <InlineWidget url='https://calendly.com/eric-hubtype/botonic-office-hours' pageSettings={{hideEventTypeDetails: true, hideLandingPageDetails: true}} styles={{height: 700}} />
}

<Calendly />

Also remember that our [public Slack channel](http://slack.botonic.io/) is available for you to get in touch at any time you want.

Talk to you soon! ðŸ˜‰
