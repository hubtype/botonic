# **Creating Your First Bot**

Now that you have [Botonic and its dependencies installed](/getting-started/installation), you can build your first bot!

In this tutorial you will:

1. [Start a new Botonic bot](#starting-a-new-botonic-bot)
2. [Test the bot locally](#testing-the-bot-locally)
3. [Understand the project structure](#project-structure)
4. [Add basic functionality to your bot](#adding-basic-functionality-to-your-bot)
5. [Add Natural Language Understanding](#adding-natural-language-understanding)

Letâ€™s get started!

## Starting a new Botonic Bot

To start a new bot, open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
botonic new testBot blank
```

* `new` will tell the CLI to create a new bot.
* `testBot` will be the directory name for your project.
* `blank` will be the starter template for your project.

Along with creating your project, this will also install node modules for the application, and make the first build.

Along with the blank template, Botonic also provides the following official templates:

* `tutorial`: a bot that explains you some basic concepts in Botonic. This template has lots of comments in its code so you can learn by reading through the source files.
* `childs`: a simple example on how `childRoutes` works.
* `dynamic_carousel`: a bot that gets data from an external API and renders a Carousel (see: [RCML](/main-concepts/rich-conversational-markup-language)).
* `handoff`: a simple bot that transfer the conversation into Hubtype Desk. (see: [human handOff](/tutorials-and-examples/human-handoff))
* `intent`: a bot that use external AI like DialogFlow.

If you donâ€™t specify a template at the start, you will be prompted to pick one.

## Testing the bot locally

Now, you can `cd` into the folder that was created. To get a quick preview of your bot in your browser, use the `serve` command.

```bash
cd testBot
botonic serve
```
*If you are running windows use `npm run start` instead of `botonic serve`*

This will give you a local browser url where you can have a chat session with your bot. Just type any text and press enter to send a message to the bot. If you started with the "blank" template the bot will always respond with "I don't understand you".

## Project Structure

* `routes.js`: Here you'll define routes, which maps user inputs and payloads to actions. You can use imported subroutes from other files.
* `integrations.js`: Define your integrations keys with 3rd party services, like NLP platforms.
* `locales`: Locales are objects from which your bot takes your multilanguage definitions. This is useful if you want that your bot addresses to different audiences. The `locales/index.js` file is where all the languages are imported.
* `webviews`: Webviews are small web pages that pop up in the middle of the conversation flow. This lets you offer experiences and features that might be difficult to offer with message bubbles, such as picking products to buy, seats to book, or dates to reserve.
* `actions`: Actions are the units of logic that your bot can perform and where the responses of your bot are defined. You are free to organize them into subdirectories.
* `assets`: Assets is where you can store all the media required for your bot. 
* `...`: The rest of the files are needed for the [babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Botonic](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic) project configuration. We suggest you to not modify its contents, and if not, it's at your own risk!

## Adding basic functionality to your bot

Let's start by creating an "echo" bot that just repeats what the user say. So if the user says "hello world" the bot will respond with "hello world".

### Create a route

The first step is to create a route that captures any text. Edit your `src/routes.js` file and add a new rule `{path: 'echo', text: /^.+$/, action: Echo}` inside the `routes` section:

```javascript
import Echo from './actions/echo'

export const routes = [
  {path: 'echo', text: /^.+$/, action: Echo}
]
```

* `path: 'echo'` means the path that the bot flow has taken.
* `text: /^.+$/` means that this route will capture any text that matches this regular expression.
* `action: "echo"` means that when a user input is matched by this rule, the action named "echo" (that we're going to create in the next step) will be triggered.

### Create an action

Next, create a new file inside `src/actions` named "echo.js" and paste this code:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { RequestContext, Text } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static contextType = RequestContext

  render() {
    return <Text>{this.context.input.data}</Text>
  }
}
```

This is the code that will be executed when the user types anything. As you can see, this is just a React component.

* `render`: this is where you construct the answer of your bot. In this example we return just one message 'Text' whose content is the user input. This data is stored in the variable `context.input.data`.

> ### NOTE:
> Usually the `render` method spits out HTML code in a typical React project. However, this is sent to messaging platforms like Whatsapp or Facebook Messenger so sending HTML won't work. We've created this HTML-like language called [Rich Conversational Markup Language (RCML)](/api/rich-conversational-markup-language) to help you construct the bot response in a dynamic way.

Now try to execute `botonic serve` again and type "hello world" ðŸ˜Š

## Adding Natural Language Understanding

You can go a long way capturing user inputs using regular expressions, but it obviously has its limitations. As you find yourself adding more and more functionality to your bot you get to a point where you need Natural [Language Understanding (NLU)](/api/nlu) capabilities.

NLU lets you capture user inputs by "intent" instead of parsing its raw text. An intent represents all the different ways users can express a unit of meaning that is valid for your bot. For example, you can group the sentences "What's the weather in California?" and "Do you know if it's sunny today in California?" to the intent `get_weather` and the parameter `city=California`. You can then map that intent to an action using a route.

Botonic has a NLU module under development, meanwhile, you can use our Dialogflow integration. [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/) is Google's NLU as a service.

### 1. Create a free Dialogflow account

The first thing you need to do is to signup to [Dialogflow](https://console.dialogflow.com/). You can do it with your Google account and it's completely free.

Then you have to create an agent (name it as you wish), click on "Prebuilt Agents", find "Small Talk", click on IMPORT and choose "Create a new project". This will instantly make our bot understand typical chit-chat sentences like "how old are you" or "you're annoying".

Next, go to your agent Settings (click on the little gear icon on the top left) and copy your **client access token**.

### 2. Integrate Dialogflow into your bot

All you have to do to make the integration is to paste your Dialogflow access token in your `integrations.js` file:

```javascript
export const integrations = {
  dialogflow: {
    token: 'YOUR_DIALOGFLOW_API_TOKEN' // <-- Put your token here
  }
}
```

If this configuration is set, Botonic will automatically send any user input to Dialogflow and get the intent, which then you can match against in your routes.

### 3. Add new routes and actions

Now it's just a matter of adding more routes that capture different intents and their corresponding actions. For instance, you can add these routes:

```javascript
import Age from './actions/age'
import Smalltalk from './actions/smalltalk'
import Echo from './actions/echo'

export const routes = [
  {path:'age', intent: "smalltalk.agent.age", action: Age},
  {path:'smalltalk', intent: /^smalltalk/, action: Smalltalk},
  {path: 'echo', text: /^.+$/, action: Echo}
]
```

* `{path:'age', intent: "smalltalk.agent.age", action: Age}` will match exactly the intent "smalltalk.agent.age".
* `{path:'smalltalk', intent: /^smalltalk/, action: Smalltalk}` will match any other "smalltalk" intent.

Routes are checked in order, that's why we put the more specific ones first and the more generic at the end.

Finally, just crete a couple of actions that respond to these intents:

**src/actions/age.js**

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Text>I'm older than the universe itself</Text>
  }
}
```

**src/actions/smalltalk.js**

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text, Image } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <Text>
          I'm not interested in talking about that...
        </Text>
        <Image src='https://i.pinimg.com/originals/eb/4d/d1/eb4dd12ae0b4a57a3fbb85e61d0c1cf4.gif' />
      </>
    )
  }
}
```

That's it! You can run `botonic serve` and play a little bit. Try adding more routes/actions for different Dialogflow intents. When you're ready, go to the next section to learn how to put your bot in production and publish it to messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger.
