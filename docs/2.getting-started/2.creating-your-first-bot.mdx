# **Creating Your First Bot**

Now that you have [Botonic and its dependencies installed](/getting-started/installation), you can build your first bot!

In this tutorial you will:

1. [Start a new Botonic bot](#starting-a-new-botonic-bot)
2. [Test the bot locally](#testing-the-bot-locally)
3. [Understand the project structure](#project-structure)
4. [Add basic functionality to your bot](#adding-basic-functionality-to-your-bot)
5. [Add Natural Language Understanding](#adding-natural-language-understanding)

Let’s get started!

## Starting a new Botonic Bot

To start a new bot, open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
botonic new testBot nlu
```

- `new` will tell the CLI to create a new bot.
- `testBot` will be the directory name for your project.
- `nlu` will be the starter template for your project, which includes NLU capabilities.

Along with creating your project, this will also install node modules for the application, and make the first build.

Along with the nlu template, Botonic also provides the following official templates:

- `blank`: a template with empty actions.
- `tutorial`: a bot that explains some basic concepts in Botonic. This template has lots of comments in its code so you can learn by reading through the source files.
- `childs`: a simple example on how `childRoutes` work.
- `dynamic_carousel`: a bot that gets data from an external API and renders a Carousel (see: [RCML](/main-concepts/rich-conversational-markup-language)).
- `handoff`: a simple bot that transfers the conversation into Hubtype Desk. (see: [human handOff](/tutorials-and-examples/human-handoff))
- `intent`: a bot that uses external AI like DialogFlow.

If you don’t specify a template at the start, you will be prompted to pick one.

## Testing the bot locally

Now, you can `cd` into the folder that was created. To get a quick preview of your bot in your browser, use the `serve` command.

```bash
cd testBot
botonic serve
```

_If you are running windows use `npm run start` instead of `botonic serve`_

This will give you a local browser url (usually localhost:8080) where you can have a chat session with your bot. Just type any text and press enter to send a message to the bot. If you started with the "blank" template the bot will always respond with "I don't understand you".

## Project Structure

- `routes.js`: Here you'll define routes, which maps user inputs and payloads to actions. You can use imported subroutes from other files.
- `plugins.js`: Define your botonic plugins.
- `locales`: Locales are objects from which your bot takes your multilanguage definitions. This is useful if you want your bot to address different audiences. The `locales/index.js` file is where all the languages are imported.
- `webviews`: Webviews are small web pages that pop up in the middle of the conversation flow. This lets you offer experiences and features that might be difficult to offer with message bubbles, such as picking products to buy, seats to book, or dates to reserve.
- `actions`: Actions are the units of logic that your bot can perform and where the responses of your bot are defined. You are free to organize them into subdirectories.
- `assets`: Assets is where you can store all the media required for your bot.
- `...`: The rest of the files are needed for the [babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Botonic](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic) project configuration. We recommend not modifying its contents, do so at your own risk!

## Adding basic functionality to your bot

### Routes and Actions

Routes are how you turn user inputs into Actions. Edit your `src/routes.js` file to add or remove routes. View the [Routes page](/main-concepts/routes) for more details.

Actions are where you define the behaviour of your bot. You can add an Action by creating a new .js file inside `src/actions`. View the [Actions page](/main-concepts/actions) and [RCML page](/main-concepts/rich-conversational-markup-language) for more details.


## Adding Natural Language Understanding

You can go a long way capturing user inputs using regular expressions, but it obviously has its limitations. As you find yourself adding more and more functionality to your bot, you get to a point where you need Natural [Language Understanding (NLU)](/main-concepts/nlu) capabilities.

NLU lets you capture user inputs by "intent" instead of parsing its raw text. An intent represents all the different ways users can express a unit of meaning that is valid for your bot. For example, you can group the sentences "What's the weather in California?" and "Do you know if it's sunny today in California?" to the intent `get_weather` and the parameter `city=California`. You can then map that intent to an action using a route.

Botonic has its own NLU module with intent and entity recognition tasks.

### 1. Install the Botonic NLU
If you are using the nlu template, you should already have the botonic NLU installed.
If not, you can use the following command from within your bot project to install:

```bash
npm install @botonic/plugin-nlu 
```
> Note: Windows users should first use the command:
> `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools --vs2015`
>
>Followed by: `npm install @botonic/plugin-nlu `

### 2. Add Utterances and Intents
There are many ways that a user can express their intent. For example the Utterances "Hello", "Hi", and "Good morning" are all examples
of a Greeting intent. 
To create an intent, simply add a new text file under `src/nlu/utterances/en/`, for example `src/nlu/utterances/en/Greetings.txt`.
Within the Greetings.txt file, you can add possible ways a user may greet the bot. Then you can reference the intent 'Greetings' by adding a route:

### 3. Add routes for intents

You can add routes that capture different intents and their corresponding actions. For example, in your `routes.js` file:

```javascript
import Start from './actions/start'
import NotFound from './actions/not-found'

export const routes = [
  { input: i => i.confidence < 0.7, action: NotFound },
  { intent: 'Greetings', action: Start }
]
```

- `{ input: i => i.confidence < 0.7, action: NotFound }` i.confidence references the confidence value of the input. The confidence value is 
between 0 and 1 and indicates the likelihood that an input has a certain intent. This route is used if the input doesn't match an intent with enough confidence.
- `{ intent: 'Greetings', action: Start }` will trigger the action `Start` when the user inputs a greeting.

>Note: Routes are checked in order. To function correctly, you'll want to put the more specific ones first and the more generic at the end.

Next create a couple of actions that respond to these intents in `src/actions`.

### 4. Run botonic train
Once you've added utterances to your intents, run `botonic train` in your command line. This will train your bot with the utterances in your directory.

### 5. Run botonic serve
You can run `botonic serve` to test your bot. 
Experiment with adding more routes/actions for different intents. 

When you're ready, go to the next section to learn how to put your bot in production and publish it to messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger.
