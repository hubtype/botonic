# Create a Conversational App from Scratch

In the following example, we’re going to build a chatbot from scratch that takes food orders.

## Install Botonic 

See the [Getting Started](/getting-started/).

## Create a Blank Project 

- [ ] Name your project by running:
     `botonic new <botname>` 
- [ ] Select the blank template and run`cd <botname>`. 
- [ ] Test it in your browser with `npm run start`  or `botonic serve`.

Your blank project is created with its basic structure. For more information, see the [Understanding the Project](/Project/) section.

## Add a Welcome Message

Let's say we want our chatbot to answer just after the user says “hi”.

- [ ] Open the `src/action` folder and create a first action file: `welcome.js`.
- [ ] In the `welcome.js` file, import the react library by entering:

```javascript
import React from "react";
```
- [ ] Import the `Text` component of `@botonic/react`.
```javascript
import { Text } from "@botonic/react";
```
- [ ] Create a `React` class.
```javascript
export default class extends React.Component {
```
- [ ] Add your `Test` component in the `render` method.
```javascript
 render() {
  return (
   <>
     <Text>Welcome to our food service!</Text>
     <Text>
      What do you want to eat today?
     </Text>
   </>
  );
 }
```
- [ ] Now open the `src/routes.js` file to add a route to this action. For example:
```javascript
import Welcome from "./actions/welcome"; 
```


## Add Two Buttons to Give the Choice to the User 

Just after greeting the user, let's say that the bot lets the user choose one option among pizza or pasta.

- [ ] Go back to the `welcome.js` file and import the `Reply` component.
```javascript
import { Text, Reply } from "@botonic/react";
```

- [ ] In the render method you were previously using in `welcome.js` , add the replies. 

**Your final `welcome.js` should look like this:**

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Text, Reply } from "@botonic/react";

export default class extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <Text>Welcome to our food service!</Text>
        <Text>
          What do you want to eat today?
          {}
          <Reply payload="pizza">Pizza</Reply>
          <Reply payload="pasta">Pasta</Reply>
        </Text>
      </>
    );
  }
}
```
- [ ] Open the `src` folder and create two files: `chosen-pasta.js` and `chosen-pizza.js`. 
- [ ] Import the react element and the `Text` component. Let’s take the example of the `chosen-pasta.js` file.

**Your final `chosen-pasta.js` should look like this:**

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Text } from "@botonic/react";
export default class extends React.Component {
 render() {
  return (
   <>
     <Text>Pasta is always a good choice!</Text>
   </>
  );
 }
}
```
- [ ] Repeat the same procedure for the `chosen-pizza.js` file.
- [ ] Back to the route files, add : 
```javascript
import ChosenPizza from "./actions/chosen-pizza";
import ChosenPasta from "./actions/chosen-pasta";
```
- [ ] Then in section `export const routes = [`, you can add rules to make the user follow a logical path such as a **payload** to capture the answer once the user has clicked on the button `{ payload: "pizza", action: ChosenPizza }` or a **sub-flow** where you can select between two options via `childRoutes`. **Note:** When using childRoutes, at least the main action must have been previously passed. 

Such as:
```javascript
export const routes = [
 {
  path: "welcome",
  text: /hi|hello/,
  action: Welcome,
  childRoutes: [
   {
     path: "chosen-pizza",
     payload: "pizza",
     action: ChosenPizza
   },
   {
     path: "chosen-pasta",
     payload: "pasta",
     action: ChosenPasta
   }
  ]
 }
]
```

## Transfer the Conversation to an Agent

Now let’s say that the user wants to get help from an agent just after his selection.

- [ ] Create a `help-action.js` file.
- [ ] Add the `botonicInit` method that allows you to perform tasks before sending back the response: `static async botonicInit({ session })`
- [ ] Import the `HumanHandoff` method from `@botonic/core`.

You obtain something like:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Text } from "@botonic/react";
import { humanHandOff } from "@botonic/core";
export default class extends React.Component {
  static async botonicInit({ session }) {
await humanHandOff(session, "HUBTYPE_DESK_QUEUE_ID", {
 payload: "end"
});
}
```
**Notes:** To do a transfer with the `humanHandOff` method, only the `session` is necessary. This is the queue name that displays in Hubtype Desk.

```javascript

  render() {
    return (
      <Text>You will be transfered to an agent to solve your issues.</Text>
    );
  }
}
```
**Your final `help-action.js` should look like this:**

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Text } from "@botonic/react";
import { humanHandOff } from "@botonic/core";

export default class extends React.Component {
  static async botonicInit({ session }) {
    await humanHandOff(session, "HUBTYPE_DESK_QUEUE_ID", {
      payload: "end"
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <Text>You will be transfered to an agent to solve your issues.</Text>
    );
  }
}
```

- [ ] In the `routes.js` files, add:
```javascript
import HelpAction from "./actions/help-action";
```
- [ ] To capture the end of the flow , add:
```javascript
 { path: "end-of-flow", payload: “end”, action: FinalAction }, 
 { path: "help-action", intent: "help", action: HelpAction }
];
```


## Add NLU

- [ ] In the bot directory, enter `npm install @botonic/plugin-nlu`.
- [ ] Create two types of intentions, i.e. two text files called `chitchat.txt` and `help.txt` in `src/nlu/utterances/en`. You must create at least two files.
- [ ] Enter the content of your choice: A **chitchat** (with content like "Good morning!/Hello!/Hi!/Good afternoon/Good night") and a **help file** (with content like "I'm lost/ I don't know what to do/I don't understand/I need help"). 
- [ ] Open  `src/plugins.js` and add your plugin. 

**Your final `plugins.js` file should look like this:**

```javascript
import nluConfig from "./nlu/nlu.config.json";
export const plugins = [
{
id: "nlu",
resolve: require("@botonic/plugin-nlu"),
options: nluConfig
}
];
```
- [ ] Run `botonic train`.
- [ ] Wait for the model to be trained.
- [ ] Add a rule to express the intent in the route such as `{ path: "help-action", intent: "help", action: HelpAction }`. 
## Say Goodbye

To end the conversation:
- [ ] Create a `final-action.js` file and the content.

**Your final `final-action.js` file should look like this:**

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Text } from "@botonic/react";
export default class extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <Text>I hope you enjoyed our service!</Text>
        <Text>Have a nice day!</Text>
      </>
    );
  }
}
```
- [ ] In the `routes.js` files, add:
```javascript
import FinalAction from "./actions/final-action";
```

**Your final `routes.js` file should look like this:**

```javascript
import Welcome from "./actions/welcome";
import ChosenPizza from "./actions/chosen-pizza";
import ChosenPasta from "./actions/chosen-pasta";
import HelpAction from "./actions/help-action";
import FinalAction from "./actions/final-action";

export const routes = [
  {
    path: "welcome",
    text: /hi|hello/,
    action: Welcome,
    childRoutes: [
      {
        path: "chosen-pizza",
        payload: "pizza",
        action: ChosenPizza
      },
      {
        path: "chosen-pasta",
        payload: "pasta",
        action: ChosenPasta
      }
    ]
  },
  { path: "end-of-flow", payload: "end", action: FinalAction }
  { path: "help-action", intent: "help", action: HelpAction }
];
```

You bot is ready so let's try and deploy it! See the [Getting Started](/getting-started/) and follow the instructions.
