# **Human Handoff**

As bots aren’t perfect, we allow the transfer of a conversation to an agent.

To configure the transfer, you must provide the `session` parameters and then the `queueName` and `onFinish`, which are optional, but recommended.

The `queueName` is the name of the queue where you want to transfer the conversation. If a queue with that name doesn't exist, it will transfer the chat into a random open queue.

The `onFinish` allows you to specify a payload or a path in order to trigger the next action that the bot will follow after the conversation with the agent has finished.

Here’s a simple example of how to transfer the conversation to the queue `Support_Queue`. The next step of the bot will be the action called `SayGoodbye` which will be triggered after receiving the payload `sayGoodbye` (which has to be defined in your `routes.js` file).

**src/routes.js**

```javascript
import SayGoodbye from './actions/say-goodbye';
import HumanHandoff from './actions/human-handoff.js'
export const routes = [
  { payload: 'sayGoodbye', action: SayGoodbye },
  { text: 'handoff', action: HumanHandoff }
];
```

> #### NOTE:
> Right now the conversation is going to be transferred into Hubtype Desk, so the `queueName` must be the name of a queue inside Hubtype Desk. In the future it will be possible to transfer the chat into Zendesk, Front or other ticketing tools.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'
import { humanHandOff } from '@botonic/core'

export default class extends React.Component {

  static async botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath }) {
    await humanHandOff(session, 'Support_Queue', { payload: 'sayGoodbye' })
  }

  render() {
    return(
      <Text>
        Thanks for contacting us! One of our agents will take the conversation
        as soon as possible.
      </Text>
    )
  }
}
```

## Open Queues

You can get an array of all the open queues of your Hubtype Desk with the simple Botonic function `getOpenQueues()`.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'
import { getOpenQueues } from '@botonic/core'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static async botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath }) {
    let openQueues = await getOpenQueues(session)
    return { openQueues }
  }

  render() {
    if(!this.props.openQueues.queues.length) {
      return (
        <Text>There are no open queues</Text>
      )
    } else {
      return(
        <Text>Open queues: {this.props.openQueues.queues.join(',')}</Text>
      )
    }
  }
}
```
> #### NOTE:
> Both features are only available when the bot is deployed. 
When you are in development mode (`botonic serve` command), you can press the button 'Continue' in order to emulate the resolution of a case.
