# **Botonic Settings**

## NLU Integrations
Integrate your bots with your preferred NLU services. For further information see the [NLU section](/main-concepts/nlu).

## Botonic Options

`options.js` is the main file where you can define all your Botonic options. For now, these are the additional options you can set:

```javascript
export const options = {
    typingOptions: { 
        delay: 1,
        typing: 2 
    }
}
```

In `typingOptions` you can define the expected behaviours of your bot when sending messages.
  * `delay`: Specifies the seconds that pass before sending the order to process the user input.
  * `typing`: Specifies how much seconds the typing component has to be displayed.

Both options are set to 0 by default. Feel free to tune these parameters to obtain the expected behaviour of your bot.
  
You can also define these settings inside your messages. In this case, the values defined inside a message will have preference over the default settings.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return (
        <>
            <Text delay='2'>
                Hi!
            </Text>
            <Text typing='1'>
                How are you?
            </Text>
            <Text delay='1' typing='1'>
                I am very glad to see you again.
            </Text>
        </>
    )
  }
}
```
