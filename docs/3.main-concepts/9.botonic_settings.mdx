# **Botonic Settings**

`botonic.config.js` is the main file where you can define all your Botonic settings. For now, these are the additional options you can set:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    integrations: {
        dialogflow: {
            token: "YOUR_DIALOGFLOW_API_TOKEN"
        }
    },
    typingOptions: { 
    	delay: 1,
    	typing: 2 
    }
}
```

## NLU Integrations
Integrate your bots with your preferred NLU services. For further information see the [NLU section](/main-concepts/nlu).

## Typing Options
In `typingOptions` you can define the expected behaviours of your bot when sending messages.
  * `delay`: Specifies the seconds that pass before sending the order to process the user input.
  * `typing`: Specifies how much seconds the typing component has to be displayed.

Both options are set to 0 by default. Feel free tuninng these parameters to obtain the expected behaviour of your bot.
  
  If necessary, you can also define these settings inside your messages. In this case, the values defined inside a message will have preference over the default settings of `botonic.config.js`.

```javascript
import React from 'react'

export default class extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return (
        <messages>
            <message type="text" delay="2">
                Hi!
            </message>
            <message type="text" typing="1">
                How are you?
            </message>
            <message type="text" delay="1" typing="1">
                I am very glad to see you again.
            </message>
        </messages>
    )
  }
}
```
