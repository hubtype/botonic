# **Actions**

Actions consist of a simple units of logic that your bot can perform and the response that your bot will generate.

## Simple actions

Botonic allows creating simple actions without any logic inside. The simplest response form of an action is a simple plain text.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Text>Hello World</Text>
  }
}
```

With some little modifications, we can also pass variables or external responses to the render method.

The `botonicInit` function it's always called before the `render()`. With this feature, we can do all the external api calls and use the response in the `render()` method.

The data returned in this function it's available in `this.props`.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text, RequestContext } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static contextType = RequestContext

  static async botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath }) {
    session.name = 'John Doe' // <-- Variable stored in session
    var reminder = 'Mathematics'
    return { reminder } // <-- Variable to be used locally
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <Text>Hi {this.context.session.name}, I really like your history!</Text>
        <Text>
          By the way, do you remember that today you have the lesson of{' '}
          {this.props.reminder}?
        </Text>
      </>
    )
  }
}
```

This will produce the following output in Facebook Messenger:

<img
  src="https://botonic-doc-static.netlify.com/images/john_doe.png"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '100%' }}
/>

## Data persistance

We can access to different type of information inside the `botonicInit` function.

- **input:** the type of data and the user input.  
  `{'type': 'text', 'data': 'Hello, it's my first interaction'}`
- **session**: the session is a group of variables that is always available at any action of the bot. It's recalculated every time there is an user input, so if a variable is updated in any state of the bot, this variable is going to be available and updated in all the others actions.
- **params**: when a [Button](/main-concepts/rich-conversational-markup-language) redirects you to an action, you can pass attributes to that action. The params store this information.
- **lastRoutePath**: the last path that the user has go through.

The `render()` is the function that describes what it will be returned as an output of the bot using [RCML](/api/rich-conversational-markup-language). All the variables returned in `botonicInit` are stored in `{this.props}`. In this example, you can see two ways of retrieving these variables, in order of appearance:

- **from session:** which is always available, as mentioned
- **as a local variable:** variables returned in `botonicInit` are accessible only in the current action

## Complex actions

The essential purpose of Botonic is having the full control of the bot. By this way, you can enable [ExternalCalls](#ExternalCalls) with `botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath })` method and allowing the [HumanHandoff](#humanhandoff) or [Internationalization](#internationalization) in an easy way.

#### ExternalCalls

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch'
import { Text, RequestContext } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static contextType = RequestContext

  static async botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath }) {
    const api_key = 'uid8900-40385330-57'
    const url =
      'http://api.shopstyle.com/api/v2/products?pid=' +
      api_key +
      '&fts=' +
      input.data +
      '&offset=0&limit=5'
    const res = await fetch(url, {
      url: url,
      method: 'GET',
      params: {}
    })

    session.resp = await res.json()
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <>
        {this.context.session.resp.products.map((e, i) => (
          <Text key={i}>
            Product: {e.name}, Price: {e.priceLabel}
          </Text>
        ))}
      </>
    )
  }
}
```

> #### NOTE:
>
> In order to import the `fetch` function from `isomorphic-fetch`, you need to install it into your bot. Please do: `npm install isomorphic-fetch`
