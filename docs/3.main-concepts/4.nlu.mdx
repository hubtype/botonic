# **NLU**

`Dialogflow` has agents that are best described as `NLU (Natural Language Understanding)` modules. They can be used by your app, product, or service to transform natural user requests into actionable data. This transformation occurs when a user input matches one of the intents inside your agent.

To do this, you need to integrate `dialogflow`. The integration with `dialogflow` is super easy. First, go to `http://dialogflow.com` and sign up for free. Afterwards, create a new agent. Once you have the agent created, you can follow the steps in the `dialogflow docs` to obtain your `api token`. Finally, enter `botonic.config.js` and add the `api token` to enable the integration. It should look like this:

```javascript
export const integrations: {
    dialogflow: {
        token: "YOUR_DIALOGFLOW_API_TOKEN"
    }
}
```
`Dialogflow` allows us to create different `intents` and assign key words or phrases. These will match with the `intent` and redirect to the corresponding route.

Below, we see how we might use intents in the routes (with the integration with dialogflow enabled):

```javascript
import Funny from './actions/funny'

export const routes = [
	{path: 'funny', intent: 'smalltalk.agent.funny', action: Funny},
	{path: 'good', intent: 'smalltalk.agent.good', action: Funny},
	{path: 'agent', intent: 'smalltalk.user.likes_agent', action: Funny}
]
```

`Dialogflow` also has `entities` which are used for extracting parameter values from natural language inputs. One or more `entities` can be stored inside the `input`. 

In `routes.js` we can use `entities` in the routes field like we use `text`, `payloads`, `intents`, etc. In this case, we have to do it through a function that verifies that entity is equal to a certain value. 

```javascript
{path: 'cities', entities: (e) => e.cities == 'New York City', action: Cities}

```
Once matched, it will continue to execute the corresponding action.
