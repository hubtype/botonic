# **NLU**

`Dialogflow` has agents that are best described as `NLU (Natural Language Understanding)` modules. They can be used by your app, product, or service to transform natural user requests into actionable data. This transformation occurs when a user input matches one of the intents inside your agent.

To do this, we need to integrate `dialogflow`. Below, we have the steps to follow:

The integration with `dialogflow` is super easy. First of all, we need to go to `http://dialogflow.com` and sign up for free. Afterwards, we have to create a new agent. Once we have the agent created, we can follow the steps in the `dialogflow docs` to obtain our `api token`. Finally, we have to enter in `botonic.config.js` and add the `api token` to enable the integration. Below we see the code:

```javascript
export const integrations: {
    /* Uncomment this to enable NLP with Dialogflow
    dialogflow: {
        token: "YOUR_DIALOGFLOW_API_TOKEN"
    }*/
}
```
`Dialogflow` allows us to create different `intents` and assign key words or phrases. So, when we write any of them, matches with the `intent` and redirects to the corresponding route.

Below, we see how to captures different intents (we need the integration with dialogflow enabled, as we have seen above):

```javascript
import { Funny } from './actions/funny'

export const routes = [
	{path: 'funny', intent: 'smalltalk.agent.funny', action: Funny},
	{path: 'good', intent: 'smalltalk.agent.good', action: Funny},
	{path: 'agent', intent: 'smalltalk.user.likes_agent', action: Funny}
]
```

`Dialogflow` also has `entities` which are used for extracting parameter values from natural language inputs. `Entities` are stored inside the `input` and there can be more than one. 

Also, in `routes.js` we can use `entities` in routes field like we use `text`, `payloads`, `intents`, etc. In this case, we have to do it through a function that verifies that entity is equal to a certain value. 

```javascript
{path: 'cities', entities: (e) => e.cities == 'New York City', action: Cities}

```
Once the match exists, it will continue to execute the corresponding action.
