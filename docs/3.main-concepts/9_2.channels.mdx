# **Channels Integrations**

## Facebook Messenger

Facebook Messenger is one of the best messenger platforms for deploying chatbots.
It has a variety of [components](/main-concepts/components) outputs.
With Hubtype, you can integrate your chatbot in a facebook webpage with a single click.

Once your bot is deployed, login into your Hubtype account in `https://app.hubtype.com/`. Then go to your bot section (in the left pannel), and click Integrations.

Click the Facebook option, and just follow the three steps instructions. When you finally click `Connect Page`, it will immediately connect your bot with that Facebook Page.

## Telegram

As seen in Facebook Messenger integration, you need to login into `https://app.hubtype.com/` when your bot is deployed.
Then, just click the Telegram option.

For connecting Telegram, you need to create a Bot from the Telegram app.
Then add the bot username and token and press the `Connect bot` button.

## Twitter

When your bot is deployed, login into `https://app.hubtype.com/`, click the Twitter option, and follow the integration steps required.

One important limitation in the Twitter integration is that in your Twitter App you can only have a unique webhook per environment. So it's important to check this option when you want to integrate your bot into your Twitter App.

## Webchat

With the webchat integration, you can integrate your chatbot into your personal webpage.
This integration is 100% editable, meaning that you can display all messages with your own style.

When you have deployed your bot and logged into `https://app.hubtype.com/`, click into the Webchat option, create a name for this integration (because you can have multiple webchat integrations with the same bot), and click `Enable Webchat`.

Some HTML code will be displayed. This code needs to be injected in your webpage.
Note that the script has to be injected in the `header` tag, and the initialization of the bot must be in the `body` tag.

You can take a look at a full example in [Custom Webchat](/tutorials-and-examples/custom-webchat).
