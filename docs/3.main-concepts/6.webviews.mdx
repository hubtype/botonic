# **Webviews**

Webviews are an essential part of Botonic and chatbots. This allows you to open standard webpages during a chat conversation, offering a rich experience and a set of features that are difficult to create with simple RCML messages.

One simple example could be the posibility of creating a webview for picking different products, selecting a range of dates from a datepicker or even buying some books.

With Botonic, it's easier to create webview than developing by your own a webpage and integrate it with the Facebook app, insert the Facebook SDK, keep the bot conversation flow, etc.

## Structure of webviews directory

All the code related to webviews resides into its respective `src/webviews` directory. These are the essential elements it has to contain:

- **index.js**: in index.js is where we define all the React Components inside the class WebviewApp. Additionaly, it includes in its constructor method, a way of defining the locales object from the bot.
- **componentA.js**: simple React Components you develop.

> #### NOTE:
>
> The main purpose of this structure is that you don't have to worry about the communication between the bot and the webviews, in order that you can focus just on adding new components to index.js and developing new components, so if you do any modifications, do it at your own risk!

## **Steps**

Now, let's integrate the bot with the webviews.

## Invoking the webview

You can only open a webview after a `button`. For this example, create an action to invoke the webviews, as shown in the example. In this case, we named a route which will be resolved by `src/webviews/index.js`.

We can pass params into the new component as shown below.

**src/actions/invoking_webviews.js**

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import {
  Text,
  Carousel,
  Element,
  Pic,
  Title,
  Subtitle,
  Button
} from '@botonic/react'

import Example from '../webviews/example'

export default class extends React.Component {
  render() {
    //Here we render a Facebook Carousel with its propers assets and url routes for the webview
    return (
      <>
        <Text>
          Here I lend you some options of how helpful the use of Facebook
          webviews could be.
        </Text>
        <Carousel>
          <Element>
            <Pic src="https://botonic.io/images/botonic_react_logo-p-500.png" />
            <Title>Interacting with the bot</Title>
            <Subtitle>See how the communication bot-webview is done</Subtitle>
            <Button webview={Example} params={{ hola: 1 }}>
              Go
            </Button>
          </Element>
        </Carousel>
      </>
    )
  }
}
```

> #### NOTE:
>
> You can also set the [dimensions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webview/#height) of the webview (available on Messenger phone version).

## Creating a component

First of all, we create a new component inside `src/webviews`.

**src/webviews/Example.js**

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { RequestContext } from '@botonic/react'

export default class Example extends React.Component {
  //for further information, see: https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
  static contextType = RequestContext

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Webview: Example</h1>
        <p>Params: {JSON.stringify(this.context.params)}</p>
        <button
          onClick={() =>
            this.context.closeWebview({
              path: 'hi',
              params: { date: new Date() }
            })
          }
        >
          Select today
        </button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

> #### NOTE:
>
> The closeWebview function allows you to send data back to the bot in order to continue with the conversation flow.
> In this example, you can see that we have a button, and when it's triggered we send the `path` to the bot with a parambs object which contains a new Date.

## Adding components into routes

After having our component created, now we can move to `src/webviews/index.js`. Simply, add the new Component that we have just created.

```javascript
import { WebviewApp } from '@botonic/react/webview'

import { locales } from '../locales'
import Example from './example'

const webviews = [Example]

export default new WebviewApp({ webviews, locales })
```

_This an element to invoke the webview:_

<img
  src="https://botonic-doc-static.netlify.com/images/webview_carrousel.png"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '60%' }}
/>

_This is how it looks the webview on Facebook Messenger:_

<img
  src="https://botonic-doc-static.netlify.com/images/webview_view.png"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '50%' }}
/>
