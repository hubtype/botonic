# **Botonic Plugins**

Sometimes you may need a specific feature according to your needs and you want to build
your particular plugin that doesn't exist yet. In order to achieve this, we have to review some important aspects.

## ** Fundamental Concepts **
* You can create your own plugins to be used locally in your project or as a npm package.
* `package.json` is mandatory.
* Each plugin have to implement the methods we describe in this guidelines.

## ** Plugin Conventions **

Every plugin you create for botonic has to be under a directory named as
**`botonic-plugin-{YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME}`**.
* **Example:** `botonic-plugin-dialogflow`

In addition, the plugin directory has to be structured in the following way:
```
botonic-plugin-{my-plugin-name}
└── package.json
└── src
    └── index.js <-- This is the entry point of your code
    └── MY_USEFUL_CODE
```

>The required fields in your **package.json** must be the following:
>  * **name**: we suggest you to put the same name as the directory, for simplicity and maintainability.
>  * **version**: the corresponding plugin's version, starting by **0.0.1**.
>  * **main**: the entry point of your plugin. We suggest you to mantain the structure as it is.
>  * **dependencies**: your dependencies, if any.
>  * **devDependencies**: your devDependencies, if any.

* **Example** :

```
{
  "name": "botonic-plugin-dialogflow",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "latest"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/runtime": "latest"
  }
}
```

## ** How to create a plugin? **
For a better understanding, we will start with the most essential parts our plugin must have.
In order to develop a plugin for Botonic, you will have to create a new directory structured as explained before.
Once created, you will have to copy this boilerplate code in your **`index.js`**:

**botonic-plugin-{my-plugin-name}/src/index.js**

```javascript

// By default, we suggest you to name your class with UpperCamelCase
export default class BotonicPluginMyPluginName {

  constructor(options) {
    this.options = options
  }

  async pre({ input, session, lastRoutePath }) {
  }

  async post({ input, session, lastRoutePath, response }) {
  }
}

```

As can be seen, in our plugin we will have three basic methods:
* `constructor`: which will be used in order to pass to our plugin the necessary options (JS Objects) needed to run our code,
such as tokens, authentication keys, etc.
* `pre`: stands for all these kind of operations that we want to preprocess of our input, such as applying NLU to extract intents or entities.
* `post`: stands for all these kind of operations that we want to process ex-post, such as adding a tracking id to our session.

Botonic will look for pre and post methods and will execute them before or after the input is processed, correspondingly.

> **NOTE:**
> It's crucial that `pre` and `post` methods are declared with the **async** keyword for an expected behaviour.

Let's take a look a closer look at [Botonic Dialogflow's Plugin](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic/tree/master/packages/botonic-plugin-dialogflow):

```javascript
import axios from 'axios'

export default class BotonicPluginDialogflow {
  constructor(options) {
    // the constructor method will receive an object with a token:value
    this.options = options
  }

  async pre({ input, session, lastRoutePath }) {
    // declare the necessary variables
    let df_session_id = session.user.id
    let intent = null
    let confidence = 0
    let intents = []
    let entities = []

    let dialogflow_resp = await axios({
      // add the necessary authorization token to do the request
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Bearer ' + this.options.token
      },
      url: 'https://api.dialogflow.com/v1/query',
      params: {
        // pass the desired params which will be available from your bot
        query: input.data,
        lang: session.__locale,
        sessionId: df_session_id
      }
    })
    // Save your results
    if (dialogflow_resp && dialogflow_resp.data) {
      intent = dialogflow_resp.data.result.metadata.intentName
      entities = dialogflow_resp.data.result.parameters
    }

    // Merge the input object and your computed values to have them availables in your code
    Object.assign(input, { intent, confidence, intents, entities })

    // Return back the objects to Botonic
    return { input, session, lastRoutePath }
  }

  async post({ input, session, lastRoutePath, response }) {}
}
```

That's all! Once you have implemented your plugin, you will be ready [to use it](/plugins/using-plugins).
