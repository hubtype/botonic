# **Botonic Plugin Contentful**

## **What is Botonic Plugin Contentful?**

Botonic Plugin Contentful is one of the [available](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic/tree/master/packages) plugins for Botonic.
[Contentful](http://www.contentful.com) is a CMS (Content Management System) which manages contents of a great variety
of types, such as text, dates, numerics, images, ... These simple contents can be combined into custom complex contents
(eg. a carousel or a message box) which can be queried over APIs. Among others, Contentful offers the following features:

* Web dashboard for defining complex contents and validation rules for their values
* Web dashboard for creating, navigating and querying the custom contents
* Multilanguage content values
* Content values history revision
* Role management
* Migration and backup tools

Managing the bot contents in an external tool offers the following advantages:

* The contents and navigation of static menus, images and texts can be easily defined from a user-friendly UI.
* Benefiting from of a best in breed CMS solution.
* Updating the bot contents does not require redeploying the bot.
* Users will need to download a much lighter bundle to start using the bot.

Currently the Contentful plugin allows your bot to easily access these kind of contents:

* Combinations of the following Botonic UI components: Start up messages, Carousels and Texts. Their buttons can be configured
to trigger other botonic components as well as opening external URLs.
* Images, which optionally can be assigned to different assets depending on the user language.
* Information about Botonic desk queues, such as its name and schedule.

For the previous content, the dashboard allows assigning a list of tags to your contents, so that your bot can query
them by a given tag value.

* Schedules with configurable timing per week day, as well as exception for bank holidays or sales periods.
* Any kind of files uploaded to your Contentful account.

  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '60%' }}
/>

<img
  src="https://botonic-doc-static.netlify.com/images/contentful/content-management-token.png"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '60%' }}
/>
### **Installing the plugin**

Install the module with the following command in your bot's project:

```bash
npm install @botonic/plugin-contentful
```

Execute the following script to create content models required by the plugin. Replaced YOUR\_ID and YOUR\_TOKEN with
the space id and token that you obtained in the previous section.
```
CONTENTFUL_SPACEID=<YOUR_ID> CONTENTFUL_TOKEN=<CONTENT_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN> node_modules/@botonic/plugin-contentful/bin/import-contentful-models.sh
```

### **Defining your contents**

#### Publishing contents
Go to contentful dashboard. Open the "Contents section" and create the contents required by your bot. Remember that they will not be available until you press the "publish" button and the button becomes green.
<img
  src="https://botonic-doc-static.netlify.com/images/contentful/publish-changes.png"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '30%' }}
/>

#### Buttons

The content buttons may trigger different behaviours depending on the type of its *target* field:

* If you assign a *StartUp*, *Text* or *Carousel*, the button text will be automatically assigned to the *Short Text* field of the target content. When the button is pressed, it will send your bot a payload with value "\<MODEL_TYPE\>$\<ID\>". \<MODEL\_TYPE\> may be *startUp*, *text* or *carousel*, whereas \<ID\> will be the ID of the target.
* If you assign a URL, the browser will open it when the button is pressed.
* In two cases you should assing a *Button* target. 1) When you want the button to have a text different than the target content's *Short Text*. 2) When you want to assign a custom *Payload* to trigger a bot action.

To define a content button, you have two options:
<img
  src="https://botonic-doc-static.netlify.com/images/contentful/buttons.png"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '60%' }}
/>
1. either create a new entry:
<img
  src="https://botonic-doc-static.netlify.com/images/contentful/button-create.png"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '60%' }}
/>
2. or link an existing one (which may be shared by other buttons):
<img
  src="https://botonic-doc-static.netlify.com/images/contentful/button-link.png"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '60%' }}
/>

In the case of Text's, you can also define *Follow Up* contents. This feature is used to automatically display a second message after a timeout. This can be used to ask the user to rate the bot, to display again the main carousel, ...

#### Internationalization

To internationalize your bot, first define the list of required languages at the Settings|Locales menu of you Contentful space. It's recommended to define fallback locales, in case that any content lacks the translation text for some reason.
From the content edit page, click on "Change" at the translation section to enable the required languages:

<img
  src="https://botonic-doc-static.netlify.com/images/contentful/multilanguage.png"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '30%' }}
/>

You will see now that you can assign multiple values for the internationalizable fields (as defined at your content model)
<img
  src="https://botonic-doc-static.netlify.com/images/contentful/multilanguage-edit.png"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '30%' }}
/>

The value of referenced contents (eg. a list of Button's) are not defined for a given locale,
the plugin will deliver them as defined for the locale's fallback locale. In that case, the
referenced contents will be delivered in the same locale as the referring content.


### **Programming your bot**

Add the following to you bot's plugins.js file:
```
export const plugins = [
...
  {
    id: 'contentful',
    resolve: contentful,
    options: {
               spaceId = <YOUR_CONTENTFUL_SPACEID>;
               accessToken = <DELIVERY_API_TOKEN>;
             }
  },
...
```

#### Rendering a Contentful content with Botonic React

To render a botonic *StartUp*, *Texts* and *Carousels* with the contents configured at contentful space:

1) Create the following functions, which convert the result from the Contentful plugin to react components (They are not
implemented within the Contentful plugin to keep the plugin fully decoupled from React)

```
import * as cms from '@botonic/plugin-contentful';
import { msgsToBotonic } from '@botonic/react';

const converter = new cms.BotonicMsgConverter();

export function renderText(text) {
  const msg = converter.text(text);
  return msgsToBotonic(msg);
}

export function renderCarousel(carousel) {
  const msg = converter.carousel(carousel);
  return msgsToBotonic(msg);
}

export function renderStartUp(startUp: cms.StartUp): React.ReactNode {
  const msg = converter.startUp(startUp);
  return msgsToBotonic(msg);
}
```

2) render it from your actions. To obtain \<YOUR TEXT CONTENT ID\>, open the content at www.contentful.com and click the
"Info" button on the top right corner and copy the "ENTRY ID" value.

```
import * as cms from '@botonic/plugin-contentful';
import * as React from 'react';
import { renderText } from './render'; // the file created on previous step

export default class Text extends React.Component {
  static displayName = 'Text';

  static async botonicInit(init) {
    const plugin: cms.default = init.plugins.contentful;

    let text = await plugin.cms.text(<YOUR TEXT CONTENT ID>);
    return { text };
  }

  render() {
    return renderText(this.props['text']);
  }
}
```

*plugin.cms.text(id)* returns an object with all the fields configured at www.contentful.com. Instead of directly passing it to the renderText function, you can also process them according to your requirements (eg. you could be just interested on the text field).

3) to render the content assigned to the buttons at the Contentful dashboard,
you we'll need to assign these routes:

```
import * as cms from '@botonic/plugin-contentful';
....

 {
    payload: cms.ContentCallback.regexForModel(cms.ModelType.TEXT),
    action: Text
  },
  {
    payload: cms.ContentCallback.regexForModel(cms.ModelType.CAROUSEL),
    action: Carousel
  },
```

And define an action for each route like this:

```
export default class Text extends React.Component {

  static async botonicInit(init: ActionInitInput) {
    const plugin: cms.default = init.plugins.contentful;

    const callback = cms.ContentCallback.ofPayload(init.input.payload);
    let text = await botoplugin.cms.text(callback.id);
    return { text };
  }

   render() {
    return renderText(this.props['text']);
  }
```



#### Search by keywords

Apart from fetching your contents by ID, you can also search them. From www.contentful.com, you can assign keywords to your contents of type *StartUp*, *Text*, *Carousel*, *URL* and *Queue*. Each keyword is a string
of words that can be used to search your contents. To make the search more flexible, the plugin will perform the
following preprocessing in both the content keywords and the search keywords:

* Conversion to lowercase.
* Removal of spaces and other separators (eg. commas)
* [Stemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming), to remove suffixes without semantics.
* Removal of stop words (eg. "the", "and",...)

```
import * as cms from '@botonic/plugin-contentful';

  static async botonicInit(init: ActionInitInput) {
    const plugin: cms.default = init.plugins.contentful;
    let results = await plugin.search.searchByKeywords(
        "text to search",
        cms.MatchType.ONLY_KEYWORDS_FOUND,
        { locale: 'es' }
      )
    for (let result of results) {
    	console.log(result);
	 }
  }

```

#### Keyword edition in contenful.com

Be careful when editing the keywords in contenful.com. If you select "Tag" as the Appearance configuration for your keywords,
remember to alway press RETURN after typing a new keyword. Otherwise, it will be ignored. See image below:
 <img
  src="https://botonic-doc-static.netlify.com/images/contentful/keywords.png"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '60%' }}
/>

#### Types of search

*searchByKeywords* allows 3 different match types (all of them performing the previously specified preprocessing):

* **ONLY\_KEYWORDS\_FOUND**: the content must have a keyword with all the words from the search text.
* **KEYWORDS\_AND\_OTHERS\_FOUND**: The keyword may be preceded and followed by other words in the search text.
* **ALL\_WORDS\_IN\_KEYWORDS\_MIXED_UP**: All the words in the keyword must appear on the search text, even if mixed up with other words in any order.


#### Schedule

The plugin allows configuring weekly schedules from the Contentful dashboard.

  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '40%' }}
/>


#### Schedule exceptions

To define exceptions to the general weekly schedule, create a *Day Schedule* at the *Exceptions* section. For these days, the corresponding weekday schedule will we ignored.

<img
  src="https://botonic-doc-static.netlify.com/images/contentful/schedule-exceptions.png"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '60%' }}
/>

To define an empty day (such as bank holidays), just create the *Day Schedule* but don't specify any *Hour range*:

<img
  src="https://botonic-doc-static.netlify.com/images/contentful/schedule-empty-day.png"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '60%' }}
/>

For days with exceptional schedule (such as sales days), create the *Day Schedule* and specify the special *Hour range*.

  src="https://botonic-doc-static.netlify.com/images/contentful/schedule-exceptions-dif-hours.png"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '60%' }}
/>

<div style={{display:"flex", justifyContent:"flex-start"}}>
