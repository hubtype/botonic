# **Botonic Plugin NLU**

## **What is Botonic Plugin NLU?**

Botonic Plugin NLU is another one of the [available](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic/tree/master/packages) plugins for Botonic, 
but with few particularities.
This extension allows you to define your own set of intents and entities to be recognized within your bot's code. Let's see how to do it!
We suggest you to start with the predefined [NLU template](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic/tree/master/packages/botonic-cli/templates/nlu)
which contains an scaffold project to start with. It can be initialized by running:

```bash
botonic new {BOT_NAME} nlu
```

Alternatively, if you want to take a closer look of how to make it work from scratch, you can follow the next guidelines.


## **How to use Botonic Plugin NLU**

### **Installing the plugin**

The first step is to install the following packages with the following command in your bot's project:

```bash
npm install @botonic/nlu @botonic/plugin-nlu 
```

This command will install all the necessary stuff to start working with your intents and entities.


### **Defining your intents**

Once installed, you will need to define a new directory called `nlu` under the `src` folder of your bot. Inside this new folder, 
we are going to create a subdirectory called `utterances`, which will contain your multilingual intents. Then for every language you want to support, 
you will need to create another directory under `src/nlu/utterances` with its language code (it must be [ISO 639-3](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data)).
After having defined this in your project, you just need to add a bunch of simple text files as `{YOUR_INTENT}.txt` and fill them with the utterances you think that best describe each intent. **Every sentence must be on a different line of the file.**

For the sake of clarity, let's illustrate with an example how your directory should look at this point:

**src/nlu/utterances/eng**
* BookRestaurant.txt
* GetDirections.txt
* Greetings.txt

In this example, we have added three different intents which our bot will know how to understand.

### **Defining your entities**
You can also define your entities within the same utterances as follows:

"Book a table for today's lunch at `[Eggy's Diner](Place)` for 3 people"

With this notation we are telling Botonic NLU that `Eggy's Diner` is the value for an entity of type `Place`.
`Place` is a named entity type as well as `Person`, `Organization` or `Date` and can be accessed with the following methods:
* `Place`: `input.entities.places`
* `Person`: `input.entities.people`
* `Organization`: `input.entities.organizations`
* `Date`: `input.entities.dates`

The entity recognition system is based on [spencermountain/compromise](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise), so this is the [full list](https://observablehq.com/@spencermountain/compromise-tags) of 
entity tags which are supported by default.

Sometimes, you will need to capture custom entities of your application domain, so you can add new entity types as shown below:  

"Show me the way to Rand's birthday party by `[car](Vehicle)`"  

which you can access in `input.entities.tags`. This list will contain all the custom tagged entity types with its values.


### **Configuring the plugin **
After defining your utterances, you can move to the plugin's configuration. It consists of two steps:

### Tuning your training parameters
First of all you have to create a new file called `nlu.config.json`. This file defines which languages you want to be enabled in `botonic serve` and in **production**, 
as well as it configures the training phase parameters.

** src/nlu/nlu.config.json **

```javascript
{
  "eng": {
    "params": {
      "ALGORITHM": "glove",
      "EMBEDDING_DIM": 50,
      "TRAINABLE_EMBEDDINGS": true,
      "LEARNING_RATE": 0.03,
      "EPOCHS": 10,
      "UNITS": 21,
      "MAX_SEQ_LENGTH": null,
      "VALIDATION_SPLIT": 0.2,
      "DROPOUT_REG": 0.2
    }
  },
  "spa": {
    "params": {
      "ALGORITHM": "10k-fasttext",
      "EMBEDDING_DIM": 300,
      "TRAINABLE_EMBEDDINGS": true,
      "LEARNING_RATE": 0.03,
      "EPOCHS": 10,
      "UNITS": 21,
      "MAX_SEQ_LENGTH": null,
      "VALIDATION_SPLIT": 0.2,
      "DROPOUT_REG": 0.2
    }
  }
}
```

If the plugin is not able to correctly identify which is the language of a new input, it will use the first language from the file.

> #### IMPORTANT NOTE:
> At this moment we only support the following pre-trained word embeddings, so you will only be able to train with one of these. 
> We expect to support as many of them as possible in the near future. For more information, feel free to contact us at [Slack](http://botonic.slack.com).
> * You can also generate your own word embeddings following these [instructions](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic/scripts).

> 10k-fasttext word embeddings contain the 10k most commons words of the language.  

### Requiring the plugin

After setting all your necessary parameters, let's require the plugin in `src/plugins.js`. It's indispensable that you set its `id` to **nlu**.

```javascript
import nluConfig from './nlu/nlu.config.json'
export const plugins = [
  {
    id: 'nlu',
    resolve: require('@botonic/plugin-nlu'),
    options: nluConfig
  }
]
```

### **Training phase **
Now it's time to see how good are the results. It's time to run the training algorithm which will try to generalize on new input phrases.
To make this happen, run the command:

```bash
botonic train
```

### **Calling your intents within the code**
After having done this process, you can now develop your bot by your intents. As an example is worth a thousand words, check how you 
can use the intents we previously defined to define the bot routes.

```javascript
import Start from './actions/start'
import ShowRestaurants from './actions/show-restaurants'
import ShowDirections from './actions/show-directions'
import NotFound from './actions/not-found'

export const routes = [
  { input: i => i.confidence < 0.7, action: NotFound },
  { intent: 'Greetings', action: Start },
  { intent: 'BookRestaurant', action: ShowRestaurants },
  { intent: 'GetDirections', action: ShowDirections }
]
```

As shown in the previous example, there are two ways to define the routes:
* The intent matcher allows matching by the name of the predicted intent.
* The input matcher allows matching the attributes `intent`, `confidence` and `intents`.

## **Going live**

You can now run the command `botonic serve` and see how the bot would be like in the development environment.

_Example of how it looks in the Development environment_

Finally, deploy your bot with `botonic deploy` and you will have a bot with a customized intent and entity recognition system!
