# **Testing your components**

As your Botonic project gets bigger, it's crucial to being able to test every component of your bot for several reasons:  
* Avoid introducing breaking changes
* Decide whether the quality of the code is sufficient or not
* Find as many bugs as possible

Botonic provides you a way of testing your bot, based on [JEST](https://jestjs.io/).
By the way, you can execute your tests by running `botonic test` or `npm run test`. 
However, we suggest you to use `npm run test` for a better visualization.

Let's see how you can define your tests by looking at childs template:

**src/routes.js**

```javascript
import Hi from './actions/hi'
import Pizza from './actions/pizza'
import Sausage from './actions/sausage'
import Bacon from './actions/bacon'
import Pasta from './actions/pasta'
import Cheese from './actions/cheese'
import Tomatosap from './actions/tomato'

export const routes = [
    {path: 'hi', text: /^hi$/i, action: Hi,
        childRoutes: [
            {path: 'pizza', payload: /^pizza$/i, action: Pizza, 
                childRoutes: [
                    {path: 'sausage', payload: /^sausage$/i, action: Sausage},
                    {path: 'bacon', payload: /^bacon$/i, action: Bacon}
                ]
            },
            {path: 'pasta', payload: /^pasta$/i, action: Pasta, 
                childRoutes: [
                    {path: 'cheese', payload: /^cheese$/i, action: Cheese},
                    {path: 'tomato', payload: /^tomato$/i, action: Tomato}
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
]
```

More concretely, we want to focus on testing if passing as input a payload with the value "pizza", 
the Pizza action is rendered consequently. Let's have a closer look.

```javascript
    {path: 'hi', text: /^hi$/i, action: Hi,
        childRoutes: [
            {path: 'pizza', payload: /^pizza$/i, action: Pizza, // <-- input to test
                childRoutes: [
                    {path: 'sausage', payload: /^sausage$/i, action: Sausage},
                    {path: 'bacon', payload: /^bacon$/i, action: Bacon}
                ]
            }
]
```

As it can be seen, the Pizza action will only be rendered after receiving a payload matching 
the regular expression `/^pizza$/i`, with an empty session `{}` and coming from `hi` path. This can be defined as follows:

```javascript
import { BotonicInputTester } from '@botonic/react'
let i = new BotonicInputTester(App)
i.payload('pizza', {}, 'hi')
```

In this way, the purpose of representing an input can be achieved. 
Let's have a look now at how to represent an output action to be rendered.

**src/actions/pizza.js**
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text, Reply } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<Text>
				You chose Pizza! Choose one ingredient:
				<Reply payload="sausage">Sausage</Reply>
				<Reply payload="bacon">Bacon</Reply>
			</Text>
		)
	}
}
```

Then, this component can be defined in the following way:
```javascript
import { BotonicOutputTester } from '@botonic/react'
let o = new BotonicOutputTester(App)
o.text('You chose Pizza! Choose one ingredient:',
      o.replies(
        { text: 'Sausage', payload: 'sausage' },
        { text: 'Bacon', payload: 'bacon' }
      )
    )
```

It's that simple! Now, algonside the methods [expect](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#expectvalue) and [toBe](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#tobevalue) of JEST, you can define the entire test like this:

**tests/app.test.js**
```javascript
import { BotonicInputTester, BotonicOutputTester } from '@botonic/react'

import App from '../src/app'

let i = new BotonicInputTester(App)
let o = new BotonicOutputTester(App)

// Put a name to your test
test('TEST: pizza.js', async () => {        
  await expect(i.payload('pizza', {}, 'hi')) // Expected input 
  .resolves.toBe(
    // Expected output                            
    o.text(                                  
      'You chose Pizza! Choose one ingredient:',
      o.replies(
        { text: 'Sausage', payload: 'sausage' },
        { text: 'Bacon', payload: 'bacon' }
      )
    )
  )
})
```
