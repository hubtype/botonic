## Chatbot vs Conversational App

Before going any further, let us explain why Botonic is your best ally.

Botonic is a React-based framework that allows you to build conversational experiences.

A chatbot is an intelligent artificial agent that implies an AI-centric, text-only interaction with your bot.

**Botonic** helps you create **Conversational Applications** to deliver a good user experience by using all the typical chatbot features like Guided flows, NLU, Multi-language, Media support (images, video, location...), Webviews, Human handoff or Webchat. Your Conversation app will learn fast, understand your needs, know you and help you for your transactions.  

Moreover, to make developers' lives easier, Botonic offers:

- CLI tools.
- A typical development workflow (git, CI, CD, etc).
- An open-source and testable code.
- A comprehensive documentation.
- A welcoming and helpful community.

## Botonic and Hubtype

Botonic is a project created by the **[Hubtype](https://hubtype.com)** team. Hubtype is a platform that allows companies to attend to their customers on messaging apps by combining bots and humans.
The easiest way to put your botonic bot in production is to deploy it to Hubtype, as it offers:

- Easy deployments.
- Automatic scaling.
- Debug tools.
- NLU retraining assistance.
- 1-click integrations including Messaging / Voice channels, Analytics, Helpdesks, NLU as a service.

Now, let's get started!
