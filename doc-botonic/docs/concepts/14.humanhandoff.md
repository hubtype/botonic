As bots aren’t perfect, we allow the transfer of a conversation to an agent.

>## Configuration

To configure the transfer, you must provide the `session` parameters and then the `queueId` and `onFinish`, which are optional, but recommended.

The `queueId` is the id of the queue where you want to transfer the conversation. If a queue with that id doesn't exist, it will transfer the chat into a random open queue.

The `onFinish` allows you to specify a payload or a path in order to trigger the action that the bot will follow after the conversation with the agent has finished.

Here’s a simple example of how to transfer the conversation a queue with ID `HUBTYPE_DESK_QUEUE_ID`. Once the human agent has solved the case, the bot will receive the payload `endConversation` which will trigger the action `SayGoodbye`.

**src/routes.js**

```javascript
import SayGoodbye from './actions/say-goodbye';
import HumanHandoff from './actions/human-handoff.js'
export const routes = [
  { payload: 'endConversation', action: SayGoodbye },
  { text: 'handoff', action: HumanHandoff }
];
```

Note: The conversation is transferred to Hubtype Desk, so the `queueId` must be the id of a queue inside Hubtype Desk. [Contact us] (https://botonic.slack.com/) if you need to integrate with another CRM.
You can find the `HUBTYPE_DESK_QUEUE_ID` by checking the URL `https://app.hubtype.com/organization/queues/{HUBTYPE_DESK_QUEUE_ID}/messengers` under `Edit Queue` tab.

**./actions/handoff-example.js**

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'
import { humanHandOff } from '@botonic/core'

export default class extends React.Component {

  static async botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath }) {
    await humanHandOff(session, 'HUBTYPE_DESK_QUEUE_ID', { payload: 'endConversation' })
  }

  render() {
    return(
      <Text>
        Thanks for contacting us! One of our agents will take the conversation
        as soon as possible.
      </Text>
    )
  }
}
```

>## Open Queues

You can get an array of all the open queues of your Hubtype Desk with the simple Botonic function `getOpenQueues()`.

**./actions/handoff-queue-example.js**

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'
import { getOpenQueues } from '@botonic/core'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static async botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath }) {
    let openQueues = await getOpenQueues(session)
    return { openQueues }
  }

  render() {
    if(!this.props.openQueues.queues.length) {
      return (
        <Text>There are no open queues</Text>
      )
    } else {
      return(
        <Text>Open queues: {this.props.openQueues.queues.join(',')}</Text>
      )
    }
  }
}
```
Note: Both features are only available when the bot is deployed. When you are in development mode (`botonic serve` command), you can press the button 'Continue' in order to emulate the resolution of a case.

>## Case Handling
Each time a **Human Handoff** is done a new case will be created in Hubtype's Desk.
When creating a new case you can autoassign this case to a specific agent using `getAvailableAgents` as shown below.
You can also send relevant information to Hubtype Desk by specifying the optional parameter with `caseInfo` and `note`.

* `caseInfo` can contain, as an example, the name of the action where the user get stucked. Will be displayed in case details in Hubtype Desk.

* `note` can be used to leave a message for other agents who don't have constancy of the case.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'
import { getAvailableAgentsByQueue, humanHandOff } from '@botonic/core'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static async botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath }) {
    let isHandoff = false

    let agentEmail = ''
    try {
      agentEmail = (await getAvailableAgentsByQueue(
        session,
        'HUBTYPE_DESK_QUEUE_ID'
      )).filter(agent => agent == 'agent-name@hubtype.com')[0]

      await humanHandOff(
        session,
        'HUBTYPE_DESK_QUEUE_ID',
        { path: 'thanks-for-contacting' },
        agentEmail,
        {
          caseInfo:
            'This is some case information that will be available in the new created case',
          note: 'This is a note that will be attached to the case as a reminder'
        }
      )
      isHandoff = true
    } catch (e) {}

    return { isHandOff: isHandoff }
  }

  render() {
    if (this.props.isHandOff) {
      return <Text>You are being transferred to an agent!</Text>
    } else {
      return (
        <Text>
          Sorry, right now we can't serve you... Please contact us later!
        </Text>
      )
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** For getting the agents with extra information, sorted by the number of cases that
are attending in Hubtype, you can use `getAvailableAgents`.
