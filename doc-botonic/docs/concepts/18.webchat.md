## What is Webchat?

Bots developed with Botonic can be easily deployed to different messaging channels. 
This is due to the fact that Botonic components are specifically treated in order to be executed in a server environment such as Node.Js. 
As they are based on React, Botonic components are the perfect fit in order to offer you applications such as Webchat. Webchat is a system that allows you to embed your bots in a web page without requiring any third party messaging provider.

## Webchat SDK API

Once your Webchat is integrated, you are provided with a code snippet to be embedded in your page.
This snippet will load your bot's code and will allow managing it through the following JS functions (you can test it in your current browser's developers console).

These methods are:
* `Botonic.open()`: Opens the webchat window if it's closed.
* `Botonic.close()`: Closes the webchat window if it's open.
* `Botonic.toggle()`: Opens or closes the webchat window depending on current state.
* `Botonic.setTyping(boolean)`: Sets the visibility of the typing indicator.
* `Botonic.addUserText(string)`: Sends a text to the bot as if the user sent it.
* `Botonic.addUserPayload(string)`: Sends a payload to the bot as if the user sent it.
* `Botonic.addBotText(string)`: Adds a new message in the webchat window as if the bot sent it.
* `Botonic.updateUser(Object)`: Updates the attributes of the user. `({id: '1234', name: 'Pepito'})`

### Webchat Listeners
In the same way, sometimes you would want to react to some of the events that take place when some actions occur in the Webchat. To react to the actions that occur in the Webchat, you can define the following event listeners:

**`Snippet to be embedded`**
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script
      type="text/javascript"
      src="{BOT_DOMAIN}/webchat.botonic.js"
    ></script>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(event) {
        Botonic.render(document.getElementById('root'), {
          appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
          	onInit: app => console.log('Webchat initialized!'),
          	onOpen: app => console.log('Webchat opened!'),
          	onClose: app => console.log('Webchat closed!'),
          	onMessage: (app, msg) => console.log('Current message', msg)
        })
      })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
It can be used as well in **`src/webchat/index.js`**.
```javascript
export const webchat = {
  onInit: app => {
    // You can combine webchat listeners with the Webchat SDK's Api in order
    // to obtain extra functionalities. This will open automatically the webchat once the site is loaded.
    app.open()
  },
  onOpen: app => {
    app.addUserPayload('INITIAL_PAYLOAD')
  },
  onClose: app => {
    console.log('Webchat closed!')
  },
  onMessage: app => {
    // Your stuff here
  }
}
```

### Images

Static assets or a plain URL can be set for the following webchat properties:

- `message.bot.image`
- `header.image`
- `intro.image`
- `triggerButton.image`

**Example:**

```
export const webchat = {
  theme: {
    triggerButton: {
      image: "https://domain.com/my-logo.png",
    },
    message: {
      bot: {
        image: "https://domain.com/my-logo.png",
      },
    },
    header: {
      image: "https://domain.com/my-logo.png",
    },
    intro: {
      image: "https://domain.com/my-logo.png",
    },
  },
};
```


## Customizing Webchat

Another great advantage of Webchat is that you can customize its components. This can be done by changing the values of a set of attributes  or you can let your imagination run free to achieve great results by creating your own components from scratch! 

**Style Markdown in webchat**

By default, webchat supports markdown syntax. 

1. In one of your actions, enter the following example.

   ```
   export default class extends React.Component {
     render() {
       const renderTable = () => {
         return (
           "## Tables\n" +
           "| Option | Description |\n" +
           "| ------ | ----------- |\n" +
           "| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |\n" +
           "| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |\n" +
           "| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |\n" +
           "<br/><br/>\n"
         );
       };
       return <Text>{renderTable}</Text>;
     }
   }
   
   export default class extends React.Component {
     render() {
       // markdown={true} is set by default
       return (
         <Text>
           # Heading 1{"\n"}
           ## Heading 2{"\n"}
           ### Heading3
         </Text>
       );
     }
   }
   ```

</details>

2. Customize the style in the `index.js` file. 

   **webchat/index.js**

   ```
   theme: {
       markdownStyle: `
       * {
         margin: 0px;
       }
       a {
         text-decoration:none;
         font-weight:bold;
       }
       h1 {
         color: green;
       }
       h2 {
         color: purple;
       }
       a:visited {
         color: blue;
       }`,
     },
   ```

   <summary>Output example</summary>

</details>

**Multiline support**

To use multiple line breaks, you must add
`</br>` tags in your js file, or use a function which returns `</br>` tags in the string. 
You get an additional line break between "## Links Examples" and "---" separator.

```
return(
          <Text>
          ## Links Examples
          <br />
          <br />
          {"\n"}---
          {"\n"}__Advertisement :)__
          {"\n"}- __[pica](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__ - high quality
          and fast image resize in browser.
          {"\n"} - __[babelfish](https://github.com/nodeca/babelfish/)__ -
          developer friendly i18n with plurals support and easy syntax. You will
          like those projects!
          {"\n"}---
        </Text>
)
```

**Conversation window format**

You can customize the border and pointer of a conversation window (also called blobTick). 

- The border of the blobTick is displayed if the message border color is defined by using `borderColor`.
- `blobTickStyle` can be used to set the position of the pointer.

```
message: {
 bot: {
  style: {
   border: '1px solid black',
   borderColor: 'black',
  },
  blobTickStyle: {
   alignItems: 'flex-end',
  },
 },
},
```

- You can define a top or bottom padding element to give an exact position.

```
blobTickStyle: {
 alignItems: 'flex-end',
 paddingBottom: '30px',
},
```

**Note:** You cannot use ` blobTick` for `blockInputs`.
