## NLU Integrations

Integrate your bots with your preferred NLU services. For further information see the **[NLU Plugin section](/docs/plugins/plugin-nlu)**.

## Typing Options

`index.js` is the main file where all the stuff is exported for Botonic to make it work.
Additionally, you can specify within a `config` object a global value which will be applied to all the messages processed by the bot.

**src/index.js**

```javascript
export { routes } from './routes'
export { locales } from './locales'
export { plugins } from './plugins'
export { webchat } from './webchat'
export { webviews } from './webviews'
export const config = { defaultDelay: 1, defaultTyping: 1 }
```

- **defaultTyping**: Specifies how many seconds the typing component has to be displayed.

* **defaultDelay**: Specifies the seconds that pass before sending the order to process the user input.

Both options are set to 0 by default. Feel free to tune these parameters to obtain the expected behavior of your bot.

You can also define these settings inside your messages. In this case, the values defined within a message will have preference over the global settings.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <Text delay='2'>Hi!</Text>
        <Text typing='1'>How are you?</Text>
        <Text delay='1' typing='1'>
          I am very glad to see you again.
        </Text>
      </>
    )
  }
}
```
