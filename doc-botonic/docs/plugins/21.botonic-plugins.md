title: Introduction to Botonic Plugins
---

Botonic plugins allow you to independently implement functionalities which can be injected into any bot. Once integrated, a plugin is able to:
- Read and update any user input sent to the bot. E.g. it allows you to inject a NLU plugin, which tries to guess the intent of the user from a text input.
- Read and update any output provided by the bot to a user input. E.g. it allows you to postprocess the bot output, or to track the bot behavior to an external database or service. 


To improve your bot, you have two options:
- Have a look at the plugin library in this guide and integrate them into your Botonic project. 
- If you prefer to create your own plugin, read **[How to create a plugin](createname-plugin1)** and start coding.
