Botonic plugins allow you to add more functionalities to your bot and, for example, enable you to:
- write tracks about the user's behavior to a DynamoDB table.
- monitor the bot's behaviour with Google Analytics.
- use LUIS or DialogFlow as NLU services.
- Integrate Inbenta Knowledge Management API.
- Allows your bot to easily access Contentful CMS content.

To improve your bot, you have two options:
- Have a look at the list of plugins already available to extend your Botonic project. 
- If you prefer to create your own plugin, read [How to create a plugin](createname-plugin1) and start coding.
