Botonic plugins allow you to add more functionalities to your bot. You can:
- Write tracks about the user's behavior to a DynamoDB table.
- Monitor the bot's behaviour with Google Analytics.
- Use LUIS or DialogFlow as NLU services.
- Integrate Inbenta Knowledge Management API.
- Allows your bot to easily access Contentful CMS content.

To improve your bot, you have two options:
- Have a look at the plugin library in this guide and extend your Botonic project. 
- If you prefer to create your own plugin, read **[How to create a plugin](createname-plugin1)** and start coding.
