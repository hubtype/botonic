title: Use Botonic Plugins
id: plugins
---

Botonic offers several plugins, such as:

---
**[Dialogflow Plugin](plugin-dialogflow) | [Luis Plugin](plugin-luis) | [Segment Plugin](plugin-segment) | [NLU Plugin](plugin-nlu) | [Contentful Plugin](contentful)**

---

To use one of the [available](#Plugins) Botonic plugins,  you must:
* Add a `plugins.js` file in your Botonic project at the root of **src**.
* Require every plugin you want to be executed every time the input is processed.
* Import your plugins in **src/index.js**.

**src/index.js**  

```javascript
export { routes } from './routes'
export { locales } from './locales'
export { plugins } from './plugins'
export { webchat } from './webchat'
export { webviews } from './webviews'
```

**src/plugins.js**  

```javascript
export const plugins = [
  {
    id: 'luis',
    resolve: require('@botonic/plugin-luis'),
    options: {
      region: 'YOUR_REGION',
      appID: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
      endpointKey: 'YOUR_ENDPOINT_KEY'
    }
  }
]
```

After this is done, you will have your plugins running!  

If for any scenario you need to access the plugin within your bot actions, you can also access and run them by the `id` you have defined when requiring your plugins, as shown in the example:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'
import { RequestContext } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static contextType = RequestContext

  static async botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath, plugins }) {
    let { dialogflow } = plugins
    await dialogflow.pre({ input, session, lastRoutePath })
    // Your stuff
  }

  render() {
      // Your rendered components
  }
```
