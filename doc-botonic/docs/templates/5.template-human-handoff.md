[View on Github](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic/tree/master/packages/botonic-cli/templates/handoff)

This template shows a very simple use case where a user is transferred to a human agent through the chatbot. The conversation will appear as a new case on Hubtype Desk.

In this example we've set up a route in `src/routes.js` that triggers the handoff when a user types "handoff":

**src/routes.js**

```javascript
import TransferAgent from './actions/transfer-agent'
import Thanks from './actions/thanks'

export const routes = [
  { path: 'agent', text: /^handoff$/i, action: TransferAgent },
  { path: 'thanks-for-contacting', action: Thanks }
]
```

Then, in our `src/actions/transfer-agent.js` file, we need to call the `humanHandoff` method inside `botonicInit`.
Additionally, we check if the 'Customer Support' queue is open:

**src/actions/transfer-agent.js**

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'
import { getOpenQueues, humanHandOff } from '@botonic/core'

export default class extends React.Component {

  static async botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath }) {
    let openQueues = await getOpenQueues(session)
    let isHandOff = false
    if (openQueues.queues.indexOf('Customer Support') !== -1) {
      await humanHandOff(session, 'Customer Support', {
        path: 'thanks-for-contacting'
      })
      isHandOff = true
    }
    return { isHandOff }
  }

  render() {
    if (this.props.isHandOff) {
      return <Text>You are being transferred to an agent!</Text>
    } else {
      return (
        <Text>
          Sorry, right now we can't serve you... Please contact us later!
        </Text>
      )
    }
  }
}
```

> Remember that the full features for `getOpenQueues` and `humanHandOff` are only available when the bot is deployed!
