Botonic offers a list of templates to help you set up a chatbot rapidly.


- Blank: Template with empty actions. The bot always responds with "I don't understand you" when you test it. 
- Tutorial: Template with comments to learn by reading the source files. 
- [Childs](child): Simple example on how childRoutes work.               
- Intent: Bot that uses external AI like DialogFlow.   
- [Custom Webchat](custom-webchat): Customizable webchat that can be embedded in your website.   
- [Dynamic Carousel](carousel): Bot that gets data from an external API and renders a Carousel. Carousels are horizontal scrollable elements with image, title and buttons for users to trigger an action. 
- [Human handoff](handoff): Simple bot that transfers the conversation to Hubtype Desk. 
- [NLU](nlu): Starter template for your project with NLU capabilities. When creating your project, it installs node modules and performs the first build.
