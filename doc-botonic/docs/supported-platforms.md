Botonic supports several messaging platforms, such as:

---
**[Webchat](#webchat) | [WhatsApp](#whatsapp)  | [Facebook Messenger](#facebook-messenger) | [Telegram](#telegram) | [Twitter](#twitter)** 

---

The first steps to embed a bot are common to all platforms:

1. Once your bot is deployed, log in to **[app.hubtype.com](https://app.hubtype.com/)** and click on the Bot icon.
2. Select your bot and click on **Integrate a Messenger**.
3. Select the relevant messaging app as described below.

## Webchat

You can integrate your chatbot into your personal webpage. This integration is 100% editable, i.e. you can display all messages with your own style.

1. Give a name to this integration (as you can have multiple webchat integrations with the same bot) and click `Enable Webchat`.
2. Some HTML code will be displayed. Inject this code in your webpage. Note that the script has to be injected in the `header` tag, and the bot initialization in the `body` tag.

For more information, refer to the **[Custom Webchat](templates/template-custom-webchat)** template description.
