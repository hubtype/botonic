title: Integrate a Bot with Webchat and Messaging Apps
---

Botonic supports several messaging platforms, such as:

---

**[Webchat](#webchat) | [WhatsApp](#whatsapp) | [Facebook Messenger](#facebook-messenger) | [Telegram](#telegram) | [Twitter](#twitter)**

---

The first steps to embed a bot are common to all platforms:

1. Once your bot is deployed, log in to **[app.hubtype.com](https://app.hubtype.com/)** and click on the Bot icon.
2. Select your bot and click on **Integrate a Messenger**.
3. Select the relevant messaging app as described below.

## Webchat

You can integrate your chatbot into your webpage. This integration is 100% editable, i.e. you can display your messaging application with your own styles.

1. Give a name to this integration (as you can have multiple webchat integrations with the same bot) and set Webchat's visibility settings (you can edit them again later).
2. Click `Enable Webchat`.
3. You will be provided with a HTML code snippet for your webchat. Inject this code in your webpage. Note that the script has to be injected in the `head` tag, and the bot initialization in the `body` tag.

**Note**: If you want to enable visibility settings, you must add the `visibility` parameter set to `'dynamic'` as shown: `{appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID', visibility: 'dynamic'}`

For more information, refer to the **[Custom Webchat](templates/template-custom-webchat)** template description.
