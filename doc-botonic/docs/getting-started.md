Let's install and create our first Botonic bot!

> ## Step 1 – Install the Botonic Command Line Interface

1. Install the LTS version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/). 
2. Verify the installation version by running `npm --version` and `node --version`. **Note:** You must have at least `node >= 10.0.0` version installed. You can also use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
3. Perform a global installation by running  `sudo npm install -g @botonic/cli` (Mac/Linux) or `npm install -g @botonic/cli` (as admin on Windows).
4. Wait until the CLI is installed.

> ## Step 2 – Create a Bot

1. Run `botonic new <bot_name>` 
2. Select one of the [templates](/templates/templates) available. 

Congratulations: Your bot is created!

**Note**: You can optionally pass the name of the template as a second argument such as `botonic new <bot_name> tutorial`

> ## Step 3 – Test Your Bot

1. Set yourself in the directory you created: `cd <bot_name>`.
2. Test your bot in your browser by running `botonic serve` (Mac/Linux) or `npm run start` (Windows - For more details, run `npm run build`).
3. Copy the `localhost:8080` URL and paste it in your browser.
4. Try chatting with your bot!

**Note**: If you started with the "blank" template, the bot answers with "I don't understand you".

> ## Step 4 – Deploy Your Bot 

1. From your command line, run `botonic deploy`.
2. Enter your credentials (email/password) if you already signed up at [app.hubtype.com](https://app.hubtype.com/) or create a new account as recommended. 
3. Give a name to your bot and wait for your project to build.

> ## Step 5 – Publish Your Bot

1. Once the build is finished, go to the Hubtype dashboard at [app.hubtype.com](https://app.hubtype.com/).
2. Click on the bot icon and search for your bot in the list.
3. Click on **Integrate a messenger** and select an application.
4. Follow the instructions to connect your bot to the application.
5. Enjoy the conversation.

Congratulations! You’ve installed and deployed your first bot!
