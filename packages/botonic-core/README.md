# Botonic Core

`@botonic/core` set the basis for Botonic. This package contains all the essential definitions and utilities that are used to coordinate the different packages of the framework.

It is the main responsible for:

- Processing the inputs and map them into bot responses or actions
- Supporting internationalization (i18n)
- Operating with plugins
- Managing human handoff
- Communicating with Hubtype's server

`@botonic/react` depends on this package to work. Check more information about `@botonic/react` [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botonic/react).
