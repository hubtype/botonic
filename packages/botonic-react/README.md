Building chatbots is a lot like building websites, that's why Botonic uses the same abstractions used in React, like routes, components and JSX, so you can build modern conversational interfaces (with text, NLP, rich interactive messages and webviews) using technology you already know and love.

# 🚀 Getting Started

### Install

```
$> npm install -g @botonic/cli
```

### Create a bot

```
$> botonic new myBot tutorial
```

### Run your bot

Run your bot locally while developing:

```
$> cd myBot
$> botonic serve
```

`botonic serve` is just an alias for `npm run start` which will start a local server at http://localhost:8080. While you develop, the server will auto reload every time you make changes to your code.

### Deploy

```
$> botonic deploy
```

Check out the [Getting Started Tutorial](https://botonic.io/docs/getting-started.html) is a step-by-step guide to start building high quality conversational apps.

[See the docs for more information](https://botonic.io/docs.html).

# 📌 Requirements

Node and NPM are required. LTS version of [NodeJS Installer](https://nodejs.org/) is recommended.

You can verify the installation running `npm --version` and `node --version` on a terminal.
